    <h2>Log of Changes and Improvements to Sierra Chart</h2>
    
    <p>This list contains major items of development, items which are notable, and changes and additions which users need to be informed about.</p>
    
    <p>This is not a comprehensive changes and additions log. It only represents <em>less than 25% of the actual development</em>  performed every day. There are <em>not</em> version notes for each version. The main Sierra Chart documentation is updated as needed relating to the changes and additions.</p>

    <p>In addition to the below listed items for each version, there are also various low-level improvements, issues resolved, and small additions that a release has which are not listed.</p>

    <ul class="NewListing">
        <li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1567>1567 Release Date: 2017-06-08</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1567">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li>Increased the number of displayed  drawing levels at a time on the Tool Configuration/Properties windows from 8 to 12.</li>
  
    <li>Resolved a problem with the clearing of market depth pulling and stacking data  when using CQG  and also when there are 50 levels of ask  market depth data.</li>
  
    <li>Resolved  a problem where the date and time controls would not display properly due to a Windows issue. We have worked around this issue.</li>
  
    <li>Resolved a slight calculation  inaccuracy  with the Volume  Weighted Average Price - Rolling Standard Deviation bands.</li>

</ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1564>1564 Release Date: 2017-05-31</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1564">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li> Corrected a problem  from a revision of  1563 where market data requests may not  have been made correctly for   Data/Trade Services which use the DTC protocol.</li>

</ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1562>1562 Release Date: 2017-05-26</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1562">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li>Resolved an issue with the setting of the Value Format and Tick Size  for trading for BitMEX  symbols. Versions prior to this for BitMEX are being locked out. In an earlier release, resolved an issue with Testnet data being provided for the live BitMEX trading connection.  This only affected some versions. </li>
    
    <li> New  Input added to the Volume by Price study to exclude evening session  volume profiles other than for the last day. </li>
     <li> Added keyboard shortcut support for the TPO Profile Chart study for the   Input to exclude evening session profiles. </li>

</ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1559>1559 Release Date: 2017-05-22</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1559">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li>Enhancements to the Chart Replay functionality.</li>

    <li> Completed development of the Hurst Exponent study.   Documentation will be added shortly.</li>
    
    <li> When using chart linking, the chart tabs are now color-coded the standard link colors.</li>

</ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1558>1558 Release Date: 2017-05-12</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1558">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li> The <b>Numbers Bars </b>  study  <b>Column # Background Coloring Methods </b> and  <b>Column # Text Coloring Methods</b>  have improvements with organization and consistency.  This makes the study easier to understand.  The following changes have been made: 

    <ul>
        <li>There are separate coloring methods for percentages and actual volumes. No longer are they combined and the  behavior altered by the threshold values.</li>

        <li>There are separate threshold inputs for percentages and separate threshold inputs for actual volume values.  No longer are these combined.</li>

        <li>Percentage threshold values are  now always in the format of .01 = 1% and 1.0 = 100%, no  matter what coloring method is being used  even for diagonal comparisons.  </li>

        <li>There are completely identical coloring methods   for both the background and text. </li>

        <li>There are optional separate colors for coloring  text different than the background.</li>

    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>We are in the process of updating the Numbers  Bars documentation to document each and every Background  and Text Coloring Method individually. This will make them much easier to understand  and all technically correct  without any potential for misunderstanding. At the present moment  some of the Numbers Bars documentation involving coloring methods and thresholds is inconsistent with the current version.</li>

    <li>Existing instances of the Numbers Bars study in existing Chartbooks should update automatically without the need for changes in most cases. However, you should go through the Input settings to make sure they are correct and as expected.  Check the  <b>Column #  Background/Text Coloring Method  </b> and <b>Column # Percent/Actual Volume Compare Thresholds </b> study   Inputs.</li>


      <li> Corrected an issue from the prior release with the pulling and stacking market data column where the bid column was not displaying any data. </li>
      <li>  For the DTC Protocol Historical Data Server in Sierra_Chart, all encoding types are now supported including JSON and Google Protocol Buffers.</li>

	<li> Improvements to the  market depth stacking and pulling market data columns  where the value for a price level is not cleared unless that level no longer exists on the  bid/ask side.</li>
    <li> Efficiency improvements to the  <b>Volume Weighted Average Price-Rolling</b> study. </li>
    <li> Added  Zig Zag Oscillator Subgraph to the  Zig Zag study. </li>

This is a significant new feature which involved a significant amount of development effort  and greatly enhances the Chart Drawing capability of Sierra_Chart.  For this feature  to work,  <b Class = "menu_item">Chart  &gt;&gt; Chart Settings </b> <b> &gt;&gt;  Advanced Settings 3 &gt;&gt; Allow Modification  of Chart Drawings from Other Charts  </b> needs to be enabled.</li>

        <ul>
    <li>Restored  support for custom studies compiled for versions 1224 and earlier. Support for these was removed in version 1544  and we acknowledge that this was a mistake and created more difficulty than we had expected.  We do apologize for the issues encountered.</li>
    
    <li>   In version  1544 the ACSIL Zig Zag intermediate study calculation functions have been   changed and this had caused a stability problem in Sierra Chart  with custom studies compiled  for versions earlier than 1544 that  used these  Zig Zag functions. The solution to this problem was to recompile the custom studies using version 1544 or later. In this version, 1546, we have  solved the stability problem when using older custom studies that use the  Zig Zag functions.   However, this now requires that  any custom study using the  Zig Zag functions  which was recompiled for 1544, 1545 now needs to be recompiled for 1546 to work properly with the  Zig Zag functions. </li>
	
	<li> Windows XP is now supported again. </li>
	<li> The   <b>Color Bar Based on Alert Condition</b> study now supports extension lines  until future intersection. </li>

        <ul>
    <li>Dramatically improved the performance of saving Chart Drawings in Chartbooks. A performance problem arose with the new file format used for Chart Drawings saved in Chartbooks beginning in a recent release.</li>

    <li>   Corrected a potential stability issue with the modification of Chart Drawings from ACSIL.</li>
   
    <li> Reverted: Corrected an issue with the formation of Renko bars where the trade that starts a new bar was incorrectly being added to the prior Renko bar instead of the next bar which it starts.</li>
 
    <li> ACSIL Zig Zag intermediate study calculation functions have been changed to improve the accuracy of the Zig Zag study. Custom studies which use these functions <em>must be recompiled</em>. An indication of this is required will be a message like the following in the Sierra Chart Message Log: <em>Warning:  The Custom DLL study "CustomStudiesFileName.InternalStudyName" has just caused a CPU exception.</em>  You will need to contact the developer of the custom study you are using to have them recompile it with version 1544 or higher. This is an easy process.</li>
    
    <li>Removed support for custom studies compiled with version 1224 and earlier. This needed to be done in order to  make code maintenance easier for us. The studies will simply need to be recompiled on the newer versions using the current  SierraChart.h header file. This is all.</li>

    <li>ACSIL added Chart Drawings through sc.UseTool which specify  bar Index locations rather than Date-Times no longer should use  identical LineNumbers. They still can but when modifying one of these drawings, only the first found drawing will be modified. This is part of performance improvements.</li>

    <li>Corrected historical data downloading problem for the LMAX trading service which arose in recent releases.</li>

    <li>Rebuilt the <b>Moving Average-Rolling High Accuracy</b> study. It should be removed from the chart and added again.</li>

    <li>Support for Poloniex crypto currency exchange. Documentation will be provided shortly. Support for the BitMEX exchange is also close to being finalized.</li>

    <li>There is now the ability to detect whether to notify have a futures contract rollover based upon the date rule in the Global Symbol Settings or based on increased volume of the next futures contract compared to the current futures contract that the chart is set to.

        <ul>
    <li>Increased the number of levels used with Drawing Tools  from 32 to 64. This applies to Drawing Tools like the <b>Price Retracement</b> tool which use a variable number of levels. </li>

    <li>When using any of the Spreadsheet studies, there are new study Inputs used to  specify the name of the Sheet the chart data is outputted to. This can be used as an alternative to using the standard of <b>Sheet#</b> where # by default is the chart number.</li>
    
   <li> Added new variables and functions to ACSIL. You will see the new members at the bottom of the SierraChart.h file.  Most of them have now been documented.</li>
    
    <li>Resolved a potential problem with the downloading of historical Intraday data where there could be excessive memory use and also possibly higher CPU usage. This potentially could lead to instability  or freezing.  These are less likely but potentially possible. The new high-performance network communication core that Sierra Chart has did not regulate the amount of memory  used and would receive data as fast as possible based upon the  network speed and speed of your computer. While this is good, this can potentially lead to problems. The downloading is now limited to two megabytes at a time until Sierra_Chart and your system can process through that data.</li>
