    <h2 id="GeneralInformation">General Information</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#GeneralInformation">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>This page has information on the <b>Simple Alerts</b> feature in Sierra Chart.  A more advanced alert and system feature is part of the <a href="indexf70c.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetSystemsAlertsAndAutomatedTrading.php">Spreadsheet System/Alert</a> study.</p>

    <p>How do you know which alert feature to use? Start with the <b> Simple Alert</b> feature, and if it does not meet  your requirements, then use the  <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> study. The <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> study allows for larger formulas and more advanced logic.</p>

    <p>A <b>Simple Alert</b> Condition Formula can be specified on a chart study or the main chart graph that will be continuously monitored.  This alert Condition Formula can also be scanned for.</p>

    <p>When an Alert Condition Formula becomes TRUE, an audible alert will be given if enabled, an exclamation mark (<span class="YellowHighlightNoBorder">!</span>) will be displayed in front of the study graph name, the study graph name will be <span class="RedHighlight NoBorder NoPadding">highlighted</span> as shown below, and a detailed message will be added to the <b class="menu_item">Window &gt;&gt;  Alerts Log</b>.  An email notification can also be sent.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/simplealerttrueexample.png" rel="lightbox"><img  alt="SimpleAlertTrueExample" src="../images/simplealerttrueexample.png" class="screenshot" loading="lazy"></a></div>

    <p>The color of the highlight is controlled through the  <a href="index5795.html?page=doc/GraphicsSettings.html" >Graphics Settings</a> window. The specific color setting is <b>Colors and Widths &gt;&gt; Alert Highlight Color</b>.</p>

    <p>When an Alert Condition Formula was TRUE on the previous formula evaluation, it is evaluated again and it continues to be TRUE, there will not be a new message added to the Alerts Log (<b class="menu_item">Window &gt;&gt;  Alerts Manager &gt;&gt; Alerts Log</b>) or a sound played, if enabled. Only when the formula result transitions from FALSE to TRUE will there be a new alert message and sound.  However, when the  Alert Condition Formula is in a TRUE state, you will still see the Study Name that it is associated with, highlighted on the chart.</p>

    <p>When using one of the <b>Spreadsheet</b> studies, or when using an Advanced Custom Study that uses the <b>sc.SetAlert()</b> function, then a  Simple Alert Condition Formula entered directly on these studies is ignored. However, other studies on the chart and the main price graph can reference these studies in their Simple Alert  Condition Formula.</p>
    <p>Each study on a chart can have a Simple Alert Condition Formula and the main price graph can also have a Simple Alert Condition Formula.</p>

    <p>When writing and testing a Simple Alert Condition Formula, if it is not TRUE on the last bar in the chart, then it may be hard to know whether it is working correctly. What we recommend is to use either the  <a href="indexeb8c.html?page=doc/TechnicalStudiesReference.php#s252">Color Bar Based on Alert Condition</a>  study or the <b>Color Background Based on Alert Condition</b> study and have it reference the study that contains the Simple Alert Condition Formula you are working on.</p>

    <p>In this way you can instantly and clearly see if your Alert Condition Formula works as expected because the bars will be colored at the bars where it is TRUE. Alert Condition Formulas can sometimes be complicated to resolve problems with.</p>

    <p>It is recommended that you use a step-by-step process to create a formula whereby you start simple and then add to it. The very first formula you should use to simply see how formulas work is <b>=1</b> or <b>=TRUE</b>. This will color all of the bars in the chart, when using this study, and then you can go from there to a more advanced formula.</p>

    <p>When an  Alert Condition Formula is entered on the main price graph of the chart or on a particular study on the chart, so long as the chart it is on is open and the study is on the chart, it will be monitored  for a TRUE condition, as the chart updates.</p>
    
    <p>The chart does not have to be visible, even if it is in another chartbook which is loaded but not visible. The chart only needs to be open but can be open in the background.</p>
    
    <p>Therefore, Sierra Chart needs to be running for the  Alert Condition Formulas to be monitored.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#EnterAlertOnStudy">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>To enter an Alert Condition Formula on a study, you will need to create the Alert Condition Formula based upon the documented <a href="#AlertConditionFormulaFormat">Alert Condition Formula Format</a> and enter it into the <b>Condition</b> text box on the <b>Alerts</b> tab in the <b>Study Settings</b> window for the study. Refer to the image below.</p>

    <p>Refer to the <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#AddingModifyingStudies">Modifying Study Settings</a> section on the  <b>Chart Studies</b> page for instructions to open the <b>Study Settings</b> window for a study.</p>

    <p>For example Alert Condition Formulas, refer to the <a href="#FormulaExamples">Examples</a> section on this page.</p>

    <p>The <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> study and the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study, do not support specifying an Alert Condition Formula or using the  Alert  options on the <b>Alerts</b> tab of the <b>Study Settings</b> window for these studies.  The reason for this, is that the studies themselves have advanced alert functionality which is separate from the <b>Alerts</b> tab.</p>

    <p>It is supported to color the chart bars themselves, the background behind the bars, or place an up arrow or a down arrow above or below a bar, when an Alert Condition Formula becomes TRUE  on the corresponding bar. </p>

    <p>This will give you a visual indication of the Alert Condition Formula result and also allows you to see the Alert Condition Formula result applied to all of the historical bars in the chart, at least up until the   <b>Number of Bars to Calculate</b> Input setting with the  <b>Color Bar/Background Based on Alert Condition</b> study. </p>

    <p> It is also supported to color a study Subgraph at the chart column, where a particular Condition Formula is true.</p>

        <p>When the <b>Alert Only Once Per Bar</b> option is enabled, then when the Alert Condition Formula becomes TRUE, goes back to FALSE and becomes TRUE more than once when a bar is forming, only one alert signal will be given.</p>

        <p> Even when this option is disabled, if an Alert Condition Formula becomes TRUE and remains TRUE during the formation of a bar, then there  will only be one alert signal given.</p>

        <p>This option will cause the Alert Condition Formula to be only evaluated on a closed bar. When this option is enabled, effectively what happens is that the Alert Condition  formula is evaluated at every chart update, although it is <em>only on the bar before the last bar in the chart</em>.</p>
        
        <p>When an Alert Condition Formula is referencing data from other charts through studies which overlay that data to the chart containing the Alert Condition Formula,   <b>Evaluate on Bar Close</b> always applies to the chart containing the study this option is enabled on, or applies to the chart this is enabled on if enabled through the <b> Alerts</b> tab in the Chart Settings  of the chart.

        <p>This option will cause the Simple Alert Condition Formula result to be reset back to FALSE when a new bar is added to the chart. </p>

        <p>What this means is that if an Alert Condition Formula is currently evaluated as being TRUE, there is a new bar added to the chart, and if it evaluates to TRUE on a new bar, then you will get a new Alert Message and sound played (if enabled).  </p>

        <p>Otherwise, this will not occur because when an Alert Condition Formula is evaluated and the result is TRUE and the prior formula evaluation result was TRUE, there is no new Alert Message added or sound played.</p>

        <p>This is useful for gaining a better understanding of how the alert formula is actually being evaluated either in real-time or during a <a href = "index9600.html?page=doc/ReplayChart.html">chart replay</a>.   You can use this option, during a chart replay, to see how the formula is evaluated at each chart update and at each chart bar. </p> 

        <p>One potential problem you may encounter  when an alert formula on a study is referencing other studies on the chart is whether the calculation order of those studies is correct when one or more studies depends upon the results of another  study for its calculation.

            <li> Enable  <b class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Only Symbols in Watch List</b>. You also have the ability to scan among  all of the symbols that you have chart data files for and not use the <b>Associated Watch List</b>.  If this is what you want to do, then skip this step and go on to the next step.</li>

            <li>Enable <b class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Settings &gt;&gt; General &gt;&gt; Data &gt;&gt; Subscribe  Real-time (RT) Data and Download Historical Data During Scan</b> to ensure that the charts being scanned are up-to-date. In the case of Historical Daily charts, if a download has not been done  for the symbol of a Historical Daily chart currently being scanned, in the last 24 hours, it will be done with this option on but the most recent real-time price data will not be added to the chart during the scan.</li>

            <li>To scan for symbols where the  Alert Condition Formula  is TRUE among the list of symbols in the  <b>Associated Watch List</b> for the chart or among all of the symbols you have data files for, refer to the <a href="indexfd56.html?page=doc/ChartMenu.html#ScanMenuCommands" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scan Menu Commands</a> section.</li>

        <p> When scanning through Historical Daily charts for a list of symbols, the evaluation of the Alert Condition Formula is always performed on the last  bar in the chart.  </p>
        
        <p>If a  historical data download has to be done for the chart,  the historical data will be then downloaded for the chart.   After the download finishes there will be an evaluation done for the last bar in the chart at that time. </p>


        <p> When you look at the <b Class = "menu_item">Window &gt;&gt; Alerts Manager &gt;&gt; Alerts Log</b>, you can see what particular bar Date-Time the alert formula was evaluated on in the chart.  Look at the <b>Bar Start Date-Time</b> text in the alert line. </p>


        <p> It may be best to first download Historical Daily data for all of the charts in the Associated Watch List and then perform the scan  after that is complete. Follow the procedure below to do this.</p>
        
        <p> During a scan,  the  <a href = "indexc5fd.html?page=doc/WindowMenu.html#CurrentQuoteWindow">Current Quote</a>  data from the real-time data feed  is not added to the last chart bar if <b class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Settings</b><b> &gt;&gt; General &gt;&gt; Data &gt;&gt; Subscribe  Real-time (RT) Data and Download Historical Data During Scan</b> is disabled. </p>
        
        
        <p> Otherwise, the  Current Quote  data from the real-time data feed is added to the  Historical Daily chart, if the data is available.  Understand that this can change the last chart bar. However,  the Current Quote data still may not be added to the chart, because by the time the chart is advanced to the next symbol, the data may not have been received from the real-time data feed for the symbol.</p>
        
         <p> If the Current Quote data is not added to the chart, then when the scan is stopped,  and you manually set the chart to a particular symbol,  the Current Quote data will be added to the chart if connect to the data feed. This can mean an alert that was previously given is no longer given or an alert is given when it was previously not given during the scan.   This is something to be aware of.  </p>

        <ol>
            <li> Disable <b class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Settings</b><b> &gt;&gt; General &gt;&gt; Data &gt;&gt; Subscribe  Real-time (RT) Data and Download Historical Data During Scan</b> for the most stable outcome from scanning.  </li>

    <p>Once you have set up your studies and set up your Alert Condition Formulas on one or more of those studies, you can easily apply that configuration to other charts by using Study Collections. Save your set of studies which contain the Alert Condition Formulas, as a Study Collection. For instructions, refer to the <a href="indexc9c0.html?page=doc/StudyCollections.html">Study Collections</a> documentation.</p>

    <p>If an Alert Condition Formula is entered on a study and that study is saved as part of a Study Collection, then every chart the Study Collection is applied to will use that same Alert Condition Formula.  To use unique Alerts on charts where you apply a Study Collection, then do not enter Alert Condition Formulas on the studies before you will be saving them as a Study Collection. Enter the Alert Condition Formulas on the study or studies after applying the  Study Collection to a chart.</p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#FormulaFormatOverview">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>The formatting and evaluation of a Simple Alert Condition Formula is designed to work similar to formulas you use in Sierra Chart Spreadsheets. This is like the <a href="indexdf54.html?page=doc/WorkingWithSpreadsheets.php#Formulas">Excel formula format</a>. This means you can use any of the same Spreadsheet formula operators and available <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#AvailableFunctions">Spreadsheet Functions</a> in your  Simple Alert Condition Formula.</p>

        <p>With Simple Alerts, typically the only Spreadsheet Functions you would be using will be the <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#OR_Function">OR()</a> and the <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#AND_Function">AND()</a> functions.  If your  Simple Alert Condition Formula involves times and dates, then you may need to use the Time and Date related functions as well. Refer to the <a href="#FormulaExamples">Examples</a>.</p>

        <p>The Simple Alert Condition Formula usually begins with an equals sign (<b>=</b>). Although it is not necessary to use the  <b>=</b>.  All of our examples will use the  =. Example:   <b>=[formula]</b>. <b>[formula]</b> is replaced with the actual formula.  Example: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=  C >100</span> .</p>

        <p class="YellowHighlight NoBorder">When entering numbers and formulas, keep in mind to use the proper delimiters in your numbers and formulas, according to the <b>English (US)</b> region.   The numbers in the examples shown here, use the "." delimiter as the decimal separator. The delimiter used for parameters (arguments) for Spreadsheet functions is a ",". These are both based upon  the <b>English (US)</b> region.</p>

            <tr> <th colspan="3">Conditional Operators</th> </tr>
            <tr> <th>Operator</th><th>Operation</th><th>Example</th> </tr>

        </table>

        <p>All of the above examples return a TRUE value.</p>

        <p>In addition to all of the above operators, remember that you are able to use all of the available <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html">Spreadsheet Functions</a> because Alert Condition Formulas are based upon the same formula evaluator which is used with Sierra Chart Spreadsheets.</p>

        <p>When you want to combine multiple Alert Condition formulas into a single formula, this can be done by using the OR an AND functions. The documentation linked to below shows examples.</p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#BaseGraphIdentifiers">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>To reference data from the main price graph (This is the price graph in Chart Region 1) and other related data for the symbol, use the following identifiers/variables:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>BARDATE</b> = The Date of the bar as a <a href="indexac34.html?page=doc/SCDateTime.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >SCDateTime</a> type. For further information and for Spreadsheet functions which can be used with these Date-Time values, refer to  <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#SerialDateTimeValues">Serial DateTime Values</a>. </li>

            <li><b>BARTIME</b> = The Time of the beginning (open) of a bar as an <a href="indexac34.html?page=doc/SCDateTime.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCDateTime</a> type. For further information and for Spreadsheet functions which can be used with these Date-Time values, refer to  <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#SerialDateTimeValues">Serial DateTime Values</a>. It is recommended  to use the <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#TIME_Function" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TIME</a> function when making comparisons to the <b>BARTIME</b> identifier.
                <br><br>
                However, making an equals comparison to a time value is imprecise and will not give a TRUE result.  This can be solved by  calculating the absolute value of the difference between BARTIME the other time value and checking if it is less than a certain value like 1 minute. Example: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">ABS(BARTIME - TIME(10, 0, 0)) &lt; TIME(0, 0, 1)</span>.</li>

            <li><b>BARDATETIME</b> = The Date and Time of the beginning (open) of a bar as an <a href="indexac34.html?page=doc/SCDateTime.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCDateTime</a> type. For further information and for Spreadsheet functions which can be used with these Date-Time values, refer to  <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#SerialDateTimeValues">Serial DateTime Values</a>.</li>

            <li><b>BARENDDATETIME</b> = The Date and Time of the end (close) of a bar as an <a href="indexac34.html?page=doc/SCDateTime.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCDateTime</a> type. This is precise to the millisecond. For further information and for Spreadsheet functions which can be used with these Date-Time values, refer to  <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#SerialDateTimeValues">Serial DateTime Values</a>.</li>


            <li><b>O</b> = Bar Open</li>
            <li><b>H</b> = Bar High</li>
            <li><b>L</b> = Bar Low</li>
            <li><b>C</b> = Bar Close/Last</li>
            <li><b>V</b> = Bar Volume</li>
            <li><b>OI</b> = Open Interest of the bar</li>
            <li><b>NT</b> = Number of Trades of the bar</li>
            <li><b>OHLC</b> = Average of Open, High, Low, and Close of the bar</li>
            <li><b>HLC</b> = Average of High, Low, and Close of the bar</li>

            <li><b>BV</b> = Bid Volume of the bar</li>
            <li><b>AV</b> = Ask Volume of the bar</li>

            <li><b>SG22</b> = This is the Renko Open value for Renko bars and can be used in an Alert Condition Formula on the chart itself.   For an Alert Condition Formula for a study, the identifier needs to be <b>ID0.SG22</b> assuming there are no other studies acting as the base graph in the chart.
            
            <br> <br>
            As of version 1734, when using <b>SG22</b>, if the chart is not a Renko  bar chart, this will refer to the standard bar Open price without causing any formula error.  This allows the use of this particular Subgraph identifier (SG22) even when the chart bars are not Renko and will always refer to the correct Open price.
            </li>
            

            <li><b>SG23</b> = This is the Renko Close value  for Renko bars and can be used in an Alert Condition Formula on the chart itself.    For an Alert Condition Formula for a study, the identifier needs to be <b>ID0.SG23</b> assuming there are no other studies acting as the base graph in the chart.
            
                        
            <br> <br>
            As of version 1734, when using <b>SG23</b>, if the chart is not a Renko  bar chart, this will refer to the standard bar Close price without causing any formula error. This allows the use of this particular Subgraph identifier (SG23) even when the chart bars are not Renko and will always refer to the correct Close price.
            
            </li>

            
            <li><b>DAILYHIGH</b> = Daily High. Refer to Footnote 1.</li>
            <li><b>DAILYLOW</b> = Daily Low. Refer to Footnote 1.</li>
            <li><b>LASTTRADESIZE</b> = Last Trade Size. Refer to Footnote 1.</li>

            <li><b>TICKSIZE</b> = This is equal to the Tick Size set in the Chart Settings window for the chart.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By default these identifiers will be set to their value at the current/last bar in the chart.  They can reference any bar relative to the current bar.  To do this, refer to <a href="#ReferencingDataOtherLastBar">Referencing Data Other Than on the Last Bar/Column In the Chart</a>.</p>

        <p><b>Footnote 1</b>: These identifiers will have values of zero unless the Symbol of the chart is valid and Sierra Chart is connected to the real-time data feed. When replaying a chart,  <b>LASTTRADESIZE, BID, ASK, LASTTRADE</b>  will be set and valid. During a chart replay <b>DAILYHIGH</b>, <b>DAILYLOW</b>, <b>PREVCLOSE</b> will be 0.  The data for all of these identifiers can be viewed in the <b class = "menu_item">Window &gt;&gt; Current Quote Window</b>. All of these identifiers reference current values only and do not support the [] array operator to reference previous values.</p>

        <p>For example, <b>SG1</b> is the first Subgraph, and <b>SG4</b> is the 4th Subgraph. </p>

        <p>The actual numbers of the Subgraphs that are available with the study, are displayed on the <b>Subgraphs</b> tab of the Study Settings Window for the study. Refer to the image below.</p>

        <p>These identifiers will be set to the value of the Subgraph at the last bar/column in the chart. These Subgraph identifiers can make reference to other  bars/columns in the chart, refer to <a href="#ReferencingDataOtherLastBar">Referencing Data Other Than on the Last Bar/Column In the Chart</a>.   </p>

        <p>If you reference a Subgraph (SG#) that is not used, the Alert Condition Formula will not be evaluated.</p>

        <p>If you reference a Subgraph that has a non-zero value for its <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#Displacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Displacement</a>, then the value of that Subgraph at any particular bar, is the offset value at that bar.</p>

        <p>To reference a Subgraph from another study on the same chart in an Alert Condition Formula, start the identifier with <b>ID#.</b> where the <b>#</b> is the unique identifier of the study.  Follow this with a "." and then the identifier of the Subgraph  (<b>SG#</b>. Example: <b>ID1.SG1</b>) you want to reference from that study.   </p>

        <p>For example, <b>ID2.SG1</b> references the first Subgraph of the study with ID: 2.  The unique study IDs for all of the studies on the chart are displayed in the <b>Studies to Graph</b> list on the right side of the <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#ChartStudiesWindow">Chart Studies window</a>. </p> 

        <p>These identifiers can also be written as <b>ID:#.</b> <b>ID:2.SG1</b> is the same as <b>ID2.SG1</b>. If you reference the unique ID of a study that does not exist, the Alert Condition Formula will not be evaluated.</p>

        <p>The delimiter used in these study Subgraph references is the ".". It will always be a ".".</p>

        <p>It is possible to access the main underlying price graph in this way by using <b> ID0</b>.  So to access the closing price at the bar being processed by the Alert  Condition Formula, you would specify  <b>ID0.SG4</b>. Where SG1 = Open, SG2 = High, SG3 = Low, SG4= Last/Close.</p>

        <p>One concept to understand is that If you require an Alert Condition which involves multiple studies, then you will put it on  <em>one</em> of the studies and that formula through Study Subgraph identifiers (Example: <b>ID2.SG1</b>) will make reference to the other studies.</p>

        <p>To reference a study or the main price graph from another chart in an Alert Condition Formula, it is first necessary to overlay  that study or main price graph   from the other chart onto the chart where the Alert Condition Formula is located.  To do this, you need to use the <a href="indexc0f0.html?page=doc/StudyPriceOverlayStudy.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Study/Price Overlay</a> study.  </p>
        
        <p>You can use multiple instances of the  <b>Study/Price Overlay</b> study for multiple overlays.</p>

        <p>Once you have overlaid the the  study or main price graph on to the chart where the Alert Condition Formula is located, you then need to follow the method described in <a href="#ReferencingOtherStudies">Referencing Other Studies on the Chart</a>, to reference the data in the  <b>Study/Price Overlay</b> study in the Alert Condition Formula.</p>
        
        <p>If you are trying to overlay the results of the <b>Color Bar Based on Alert Condition</b> or the <b>Color Background Based on Alert Condition</b> study from one chart to another chart, inherently that is not reliable using the <b>Study/Price Overlay</b> study.

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ReferencingChartDrawings">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p> There are two ways to reference a  <a href = "indexb844.html?page=doc/Tools.html"> Chart Drawing</a> for an alert.<p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Reference by Anchor</b>:  This references the price/study value of an anchor point for the  Chart Drawing, in the alert. The format is <b>UDID[x].Ay</b>, where <b>x</b> is the drawing identifier and <b>y</b> is the anchor number.</li>

            <li><b>Reference by Bar Value</b>:  This references the price/study value of the Chart Drawing at a bar location, in the alert. The format is <b>UDID[x][z]</b>, where <b>x</b> is the drawing identifier and <b>z</b> is the bar  <em>offset</em>.  The bar offset is relative to the chart bar the alert formula is being evaluated on.  
            <br> <br>
            For the last bar in the chart, when the alert formula  is being evaluated, using an offset of 0 would return the price/study value of the Chart Drawing at that chart bar.  Using -1 would give the value of the Chart Drawing  at the bar prior to the last bar.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In both cases, the first part of the format is identical and uses the chart drawing identifier. The Chart Drawing Identification Number can be found on the  <a href = "indexb844.html?page=doc/Tools.html#ChartDrawingProperties">Chart Drawing Properties</a> window under the <b>Anchors</b> tab. </p>
        
        <p>In this window there is text that states <b>Line ID: -#</b>. The number following the negative sign is the identifier to be used for the overall drawing (see image below). Note that the number should be entered as the positive value, and not as the negative value that is displayed.</p>

        <section class="h4">
            <h4 id="ReferencingChartDrawings-ReferenceByAnchor">Reference by Anchor</h4>
            <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ReferencingChartDrawings-ReferenceByAnchor">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

            <p>To use a Chart Drawing Anchor Point in an Alert, enter the formula as <b>UDID[x]Ay</b> where <b>x</b> is the Chart Drawing Identification Number (as described above) and <b>y</b> is the number of the anchor point that is to be used.</p>

            <p>The anchors associated with a drawing are shown on the <b>Chart Drawing Properties</b> window under the <b>Anchors</b> tab. Each anchor shows the name on the left side of the window. For anchors that are listed as <b>Ay</b> simply use this value in the alert formula.</p>

            <p>For Chart Drawing anchors that use a different identifier format other than <b>Ay</b>, simply count the number of the anchors starting with number 1 at the top and moving down; enter this number after the <b>A</b> in the formula. For example, if the anchors are labeled as <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> on the Anchors tab, then enter <b>A1</b> for the <b>A</b> anchor and <b>A2</b> for the <b>B</b> anchor. See the image below for further clarification.</p>
            
            <p>The Anchor value that is used in the alert is the <b>Value</b> of the anchor, or the vertical axis coordinate on the Chart Scale for the Chart Region the Chart Drawing is in. The Date/Time of the anchor is not used in the alert condition.</p>

            <p>For example, to set an alert condition when the Last price is higher than the second anchor point for the Chart Drawing in the image below, enter the following alert formula: <b>C > UDID[2].A2</b>.</p>

            <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ReferencingChartDrawings-ReferenceByBarValue">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

            <p>To use the value of a Chart Drawing at a specific bar position in an Alert, enter the formula as <b>UDID[x][z]</b> where <b>x</b> is the Chart Drawing Identification Number (as described above) and <b>z</b> is the Bar Index Offset that establishes which bar is to be used to determine the value of the drawing.</p>

            <p>The Bar Index Offset is the number of bars before or after the current bar in the chart. To reference the current bar, use a value of <b>0</b>. To reference a bar that is 2 bars behind the current bar, use a value of <b>-2</b>. This is the same context as is used to generally <a href="referencingdataotherlastbar.html">Reference Data Other Than on the Last Bar/Column in the Chart</a>.</p>

            <p>If the drawing does not have a presence at the bar being referenced, then the value of the drawing at that location is 0. This could lead to inappropriate True alert conditions depending on the setup of the alert. It is important to keep this in mind when defining the alert and the bar reference that is used.</p>

            <p>For example, to set an alert condition for the drawing referenced in the image below when the Last price of the current bar is higher than the value of the drawing five bars prior to the current bar, enter the following alert formula: <b>C > UDID[2][-5]</b>.</p>

        <p>To access the data from a bar/column in the chart other than the current bar, with any of the Main Price Graph and Study Subgraph identifiers described in this section, you need to include an offset within square brackets after the Main Price Graph or Study Subgraph identifier.</p> 

        <p>For example, <b>H[-1]</b> will be set to the High value <em>1 bar prior to the current bar</em>, <b>SG1[-3]</b> will be set to the value of the first Subgraph <em>three bars prior to the current bar</em>, and <b>ID2.SG1[-4]</b> will be set to the value of the first Subgraph of the study with ID 2 <em>four bars prior to the current bar</em>.</p> 

        <p>If no offset is given for an identifier, that is equivalent to an offset of zero. For example, <b>SG1</b> is equivalent to <b>SG1[0]</b>.</p>  

        <p>If the Alert Condition Formula references a bar that does not exist, the Alert Condition Formula will not be evaluated.</p>

        <p>In the description above, <em>current bar</em> refers to the last bar in the chart when evaluating an Alert Condition Formula on a study other than the <a href="index315b.html?page=doc/StudiesReference.php&amp;ID=245#Color_Bar_Based_on_Alert_Condition">Color Bar Based on Alert Condition</a> / <a href="index9919.html?page=doc/StudiesReference.php&amp;ID=252#Color_Background_Based_on_Alert_Condition">Color Background Based on Alert Condition</a> studies. It will refer to the bar before the last bar the chart when  <a href="#AlertOptions">Evaluate on Bar Close</a> is enabled.</p>

        <p>When using the <a href="index315b.html?page=doc/StudiesReference.php&amp;ID=245#Color_Bar_Based_on_Alert_Condition">Color Bar Based on Alert Condition</a> / <a href="index9919.html?page=doc/StudiesReference.php&amp;ID=252#Color_Background_Based_on_Alert_Condition">Color Background Based on Alert Condition</a> studies, <em>current bar</em>  refers to the bar currently being evaluated by this study.

            <p>It is also possible to use a positive number within the square brackets (ID1.SG1[1]) to reference data for chart bars which are after the chart bar the Alert Condition Formula is being evaluated on.</p>

            <p>For example, you could specify <b>H[1]</b> which will reference the bar High price one bar forward. This would only be meaningful if you are using the option <b>Evaluate on Bar Close</b> or you are using the <a href="indexeb8c.html?page=doc/TechnicalStudiesReference.php#s245">Color Bar/Background Based on Alert Condition</a> study, or a Subgraph that is being referenced has a positive <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#Displacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Displacement</a>.</p> 
            
            <p>  Use a positive bar reference  of [1]  in Subgraph references to reference the  <a href = "index5ee6.html?page=doc/NumbersBars.php#PullbackColumn">pullback  column</a> data of the  <a href = "index5ee6.html?page=doc/NumbersBars.php#NumericInformationBelowBars">Numbers Bars Calculated Values</a> study. <p>

            <p>In any of these cases, the formula will be applied to bars other than the last bar in the chart. So using a positive reference would be useful. Otherwise, you would be referencing data beyond the end of the chart which normally does not exist. Although, there are consequences to using a positive reference.</p>

            <p class="GeneralBackgroundHighlightLight">The consequence of using a positive offset within the square brackets to reference data after the last bar in the chart is that during real-time updating of the chart or during a replay, the data being referenced will not exist  and your Alert Condition Formula will evaluate to FALSE and you will not get an Alert or the new bars added to the chart will not be colored in the case of when using the <a href="indexeb8c.html?page=doc/TechnicalStudiesReference.php#s245">Color Bar/Background Based on Alert Condition</a> study.</p>

        <p>In order to reference a range of data within a specific Subgraph, use the format <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">IDx.SGy[b:e]</span> where <b>x</b> is the ID of the particular study, <b>y</b> is the Subgraph number of the study (or chart), <b>b</b> is the beginning data reference, and <b>e</b> is the ending data reference.</p>

        <p>For example, to calculate the average of the last 10 bars for the Open of the Main Price Graph, the formula would be <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">AVERAGE(ID0.SG1[0:-10])</span>.</p>

        <p>When the data being referenced is part of the given chart, then it is not necessary to use the ID portion of the formula. For example, if writing a Chart alert from the <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Alerts tab</b>, and comparing the Average of the Open prices in the Main Price Graph against a constant, you could enter just the following: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=AVERAGE(SG1[0:-10]) &gt; 100</span> or <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=AVERAGE(O[0:-10]) &gt; 100</span>.</p> 
        
        <p> It needs to be understood that you cannot compare a range of individual values using a comparison operator to a single value.  For example, this is  <em>not</em> valid: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=SG1[0:-10] &gt; 100</span> . It inherently makes no sense because 11 different values cannot be compared to a single value.  This requires an iteration which is not possible with Spreadsheet formulas. </p>

        <p>There are cases where it does make sense to reference chart columns beyond the last bar in the chart.

        <p>You need to be running the current version of Sierra Chart for support for this.</p>

        <p>To reference the Pullback Column column data, simply use the study Subgraph identifier for the particular Subgraph you want to reference and follow it by [1]. Example:  <b>SG1[1]</b>.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#EffectOfValueFormatOnIdentifierValues">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>All study and  main price graph identifiers <b>O, H, L, C,  SG1, ID1.SG1</b>, ... are converted to values which correspond to the <b> Price Display Format/Value Format</b>  setting on the main price graph or study that the identifier belongs to.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the  <a href="index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#PriceDisplayFormat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Price Display Format</a>  setting for the chart will affect the O, H, L, C identifiers. The <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#ValueFormat"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Value Format</a> setting on a study will affect the <b>ID#.SG#</b> identifiers for that same study.</p>

    <p>This conversion takes place before the formula is evaluated. In other words the value will be as you see it on the chart.</p>

    <p>For example, if internally a Moving Average value at a chart bar is 841.2351 and the <b>Value Format</b> for that particular study is <b>.1</b>, then this will be converted to 841.2. So the value is rounded. So 841.25 would be rounded to 841.3 if the <b>Value Format</b> for the study is <b>.1</b>.</p>

    <p> Another example,  if a Study Subgraph at a specific chart bar is <b>0.001</b>, at another chart bar  the Study Subgraph is <b>0.004</b>, in the <b>Value Format</b> for the study is <b>0.01</b>, then <b>0.001</b> and <b>0.004</b> will be considered <em>equal</em> because <b>0.001</b> rounds to <b>0.00</b> and <b>0.004</b> rounds to <b>0.00</b>. Therefore, you can see the importance of the <b>Value Format</b> setting on the evaluation of formulas.</p>

    <p>Main price graph values are rounded according to the <b>Price Display Format</b> setting in <b class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b>. This is the main chart equivalent to the <b>Value Format</b> setting.</p>

    <p>The application of the <b>Value Format</b> does not occur when using the <b>CROSSOVER(), CROSSFROMABOVE(), or the CROSSFROMBELOW()</b> functions. The numbers are represented as they actually internally are with full precision. The only way to see the full precision yourself of the identifier values is to set the <b> Value Format</b> setting for the study or the <b>Price Display Format</b> setting for the main price  graph to <b>.0000001</b> or more precise. Refer to <a href="indexa315.html?page=doc/helpdetails32.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Changing the Price/Value Display Format</a>.</p>

    <p class="GeneralBackgroundHighlightLight">If your <b>Alert Condition</b> formula is not giving an expected result, then it is possible that the <b>Value Format</b> setting is not correct. </p>

    <p>You will need to <em>increase</em> the number of decimal places in the <b>Value Format</b> for greater precision. Be aware, that  a less precise <b>Value Format</b> setting can create unexpected comparison results which do not correspond to what you visually see on the chart with the Study Subgraph drawings.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#WritingFormulasForStudiesWithoutObviousValues">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>There are some Study Subgraphs like the <b>Candlestick Patterns Finder &gt;&gt; Pattern #</b> Subgraph and the <b>Zig Zag &gt;&gt; Text Labels</b> Subgraph which do not have obvious values because these are just displayed as text.</p>

    <p>However, in each of these cases  the Study Subgraph which is used to control the color and Font Size contain values which correspond with the particular text displayed. </p>

    <p>In the case of the <b>Zig Zag</b> study, it is necessary to set the   <b>Additional Output for Spreadsheets</b> study Input to <b> Yes</b>  for some of these additional study Subgraphs to contain values.</p>
    
     <p> Related to this, you may want to write an Alert Condition Formula based on changing colors  of a study Subgraph. In this particular case you need to base the formula on the actual values of the  Subgraph which is affecting the coloring. </p>

    <p>To see these study Subgraph values you need to use the <a href="indexb844.html?page=doc/Tools.html#ChartValues"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chart Values  Tool</a> and the  <a href="indexb844.html?page=doc/Tools.html#ViewingToolandChartData" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tool Values Window</a>.</p>

    <p>When  you move the Pointer over a particular chart bar, you will see displayed in the Tool Values  Window the value for each of the Subgraphs at that chart bar.  Refer to the image below for this. </p>

    <p>So this is a method that you can determine to values for a Study Subgraph that do not have obvious values.</p>

    <p>You can then write a formula  to use these values.  For example <b>SG1&gt;0</b>.</p>

    <p>There are some studies that color a subgraph based on underlying information. In these cases, if a subgraph is available, it is only to allow for the user to change the color for that particular subgraph. As such, the actual data that drives the color is not available. When it is desired to use the color change as part of an alert, it is necessary to write the alert using the underlying algorithm, as the data that drives the color, and the color itself, are not available for use within an alert.</p>

    <p>For example, the study <b>Volume - Colored Based on Closes</b> sets the color of the volume bar based on whether the close of the bar is higher or lower than the close of the previous bar. It is not possible to create an alert that is based on the color of these Volume Bars, but rather an alert can be created that is based on how the coloring is performed. In this case, the information for how the coloring is performed is given on the <a href="indexbc65.html?page=doc/StudiesReference.php&amp;ID=312&amp;Name=Volume_Colored_Based_on_Bar_Closes">Volume - Colored Based On Bar Closes</a> page, where it states that <b>A Volume bar is colored the Volume Subgraph Primary color if the closing price of the corresponding bar is higher or equal to the previous bar.</b> Therefore, the alert condition would be <b>C >= C[-1]</b>.</p>

    <p>Some of the examples below provide <b>Study Collection</b> files. To use a Study Collection file, refer to <a href="indexe791.html?page=doc/UsingAdvancedCustomStudies.php#UsingStudyCollection" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using a Study Collection</a> for step-by-step instructions.</p>

    <p>When an example says to add a study to the chart, refer to the <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#AddingModifyingStudies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adding/Modifying Studies</a>  documentation for instructions if needed.</p>

    <p>The below Alert Condition Formulas can be used with studies or on the main price graph depending upon what they are designed to do.</p>

    <p>To enter one of these formulas on a study, refer to <a href="#EnterAlertOnStudy">To Enter an Alert Condition on a Study</a>.</p>


    <p>To enter one of these formulas on the main price  graph of the chart, refer to <a href="#EnterAlertOnMainPriceGraph">To Enter an Alert Condition on the Main Chart/Price Graph</a>.</p> 

    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Stochastic Alert</b>: Add the <b>Stochastic-Slow</b> study to the chart. Enter the <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=CROSSOVER(SG1, SG2)</span> formula into the <b>Alert Condition</b> text box on the <b> Alerts</b> tab of the <b>Study Settings</b> window for the study.  When the %K line crosses the %D line an alert will be given.  Enter the <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=AND(CROSSOVER(SG1, SG2) &lt;&gt; 0, SG1 &gt; 70)</span> formula into the <b>Alert Condition</b> text box on the <b> Alerts</b> tab of the <b>Study Settings</b> window for the study.   With this formula, when the %K line crosses the %D line <em>and</em> %K is above 70, then an alert will be given.</li>

        <li><b>Simple Price Alert</b>: Enter <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=C &gt; 50</span> into the <b>Alert Condition</b> text box on the <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Alerts</b> tab for the chart.  This formula means if the close is greater than 50, then give an alert.</li>

        <li><b>Moving Average Crossover Alert</b>: Add the study <b>Moving Averages</b> to the chart. The study will display three moving averages. Open the   <b>Study Settings</b> window for the study.  Configure the <b>Inputs</b> as you require. On the  <b>Subgraphs</b> tab set the <b>Draw Style</b> moving averages you do not want to see to <b>Ignore</b>. In the <b >Alert Condition</b> text box on the <b>Alerts</b> tab enter: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=CROSSOVER(SG1, SG2)</span>.  This means if the first two moving averages cross, an alert will be given.</li>

        <li><b>Moving Average Crossover Alert Using Separate Moving Averages</b>: Add 2 <b>Moving Average</b>  studies to the chart. Configure the studies as you require.  Take note of the ID number of each study as it is displayed in the <b> Studies to Graph</b> list box on the   <b>Study Settings</b> window.
            <br>
            <br>
            Select one of the <b>Moving Average</b> studies and open the  <b>Study Settings</b> window for that study. In the <b >Alert Condition</b> text box on the <b>Alerts</b> tab, enter: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=CROSSOVER(ID1.SG1, ID2.SG1)</span>.  This means if the moving average with ID1 crosses the moving average with ID2, then an alert will be given. If you apply this formula to the study with ID1, then <b> ID1.</b> can be removed and instead you can just use <b>SG1</b>.</li>

        <li><b>To Scan For Charts With Increasing Volume</b>: Add a <b>Moving Average</b> study to the chart.  Open the Study Settings window for the study.  Set the <b>Input Data</b> input to <b>Volume</b>.  Set the <b> Chart Region</b> setting to 2.  Enter <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=SG1 &gt; SG1[-5]</span> into the <b>Alert Condition</b> text box on the <b>Alerts</b>  tab for the study.  This formula means if the Moving Average value on the last column/bar is greater than the Moving Average value five columns/bars prior, then give an alert.  Select <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Start Scan</b> on the menu to scan all your data for this condition.  The number 5 in the bars back operator (<b>[-5]</b>) can be set to whatever you require.</li>

        <li><b>Alert at Specific Time</b>: If you want to get an alert at a specific time, use a formula like this: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=AND(BARTIME&gt;= TIME(9, 30, 0), BARTIME &lt;= TIME(9, 30, 59))</span>. This will give you an alert when the time 9:30:00 to 9:30:59 occurs on the last bar.</li>

        <li><b>Highlighting the Evening Session Background</b>: If you want to highlight the background of the chart for the evening session trading, then use the <b>Color Background Based on Alert Condition</b> study and use the following Formula: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR(BARTIME &gt;= TIME(15, 30, 0), BARTIME &lt;= TIME(8, 30, 0))</span>, this will color the bars from 15:30 to 8:30.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is a better way to perform the same function rather than using this formula.  Use the <a href="indexeb8c.html?page=doc/TechnicalStudiesReference.php#s278">Time Range Highlight</a> study.</li>

        <li><b>Simple Alert Condition Formula for Change of Slope of a Study Subgraph Line</b>: To  get an alert when a study Subgraph line changes its slope, then use this Simple Alert Condition Formula:  <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR(AND(SG1[0] &gt; SG1[-1],SG1[-1] &lt; SG1[-2]), AND(SG1[0] &lt; SG1[-1],SG1[-1] &gt; SG1[-2]))</span>. This formula is meant for study Subgraph 1. This will work fine for any of the Sierra Chart Moving Average studies.
        <br> <br>
         In the case where this formula is used on another study other than the study being referenced, like in the case of <b>Color Bar Based on Alert Condition</b>, it is necessary to change <b>SG1</b> to include the study ID number. Refer to <a href = "#ReferencingOtherStudies">Referencing Other Studies</a> for complete details.
        </li>

        <li><b>Simple Alert Condition Formula for Change of Slope or New Slope of a Study Subgraph Line</b>: To get an alert when a study Subgraph line changes its slope or there is a new slope after a flatline, then use this Simple Alert Condition Formula:  <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR(AND(SG1[0] &gt; SG1[-1] , SG1[-1] &lt;= SG1[-2]) , AND(SG1[0] &lt; SG1[-1], SG1[-1] &gt;= SG1[-2]))</span>. This formula is meant for study Subgraph 1.</li>

        <li><b>Color Bar Formula To Color Bars Based On Whether Study Subgraph Is Above Or Below 0</b>: These formulas need to be used on the  <b>Color Bar Based on Alert Condition</b> study. You need two instances of this study. This formula assumes that the study we are referencing has an ID of 1 and we are referring to the first Subgraph of that study.   Simple Alert Condition Formulas: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=ID1.SG1 &gt; 0</span>, <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=ID1.SG1 &lt; 0</span>.</li>

        <li><b>Making an Alert Condition Formula Function During Certain Times</b>: In this example the alert will only function between 5:30:00 and 22:20:00. <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=AND((<i>Your Alert Condition Formula</i>), BARTIME &gt;= TIME(5, 30, 0), BARTIME &lt;= TIME(22, 20, 0))</span></li>

        <li><b>Alert for TICK-NYSE chart when it crosses these levels</b>: -600,  -1200 and +600, +1200. <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR(CROSSOVER(C,-600) &lt;&gt; 0, CROSSOVER(C,-1200) &lt;&gt; 0, CROSSOVER(C,600) &lt;&gt; 0, CROSSOVER(C,1200) &lt;&gt; 0)</span>. Enter this alert in <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Alerts</b> in the <b>Alert Condition</b> box.</li>


        <li><b>Alert for Commodity Channel Index (CCI) when it crosses -180,  -200 and +180, +200</b>: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR(CROSSOVER(SG1,-180) &lt;&gt; 0, CROSSOVER(SG1,-200) &lt;&gt; 0, CROSSOVER(SG1,180) &lt;&gt; 0, CROSSOVER(SG1,200) &lt;&gt; 0)</span>. Enter this alert in the <b>Study Settings</b> window for the  <b>Commodity Channel Index</b> study in the <b>Alert Condition</b> box.</li>

        <li><b>Alert for Commodity Channel Index (CCI) when it crosses its Line 2 or Line 3 Subgraphs</b>: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR(CROSSOVER(SG1,SG3) &lt;&gt; 0, CROSSOVER(SG1,SG4) &lt;&gt; 0)</span>. Enter this alert in the <b>Study Settings</b> window for the  <b>Commodity Channel Index</b> study in the <b>Alert Condition</b> box.</li>

        <li><b>Slow Stochastic Crossover</b>: This Study Collection file, when applied to a chart, will place a green up arrow at the price bar where the stochastic %K line crosses the stochastic %D from below.

        </li>

        <li><b>Alert Formula For When Difference Between All 3 Study Subgraph Lines is Less than Chart Tick Size</b>:  <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=AND(ABS(SG1-SG2) &lt; TICKSIZE, ABS(SG2-SG3)  &lt; TICKSIZE)</span>.</li>

        <li><b>Alert Formula For When Study Subgraph Crosses 0</b>: The following Simple Alert Condition Formula can be used for any study: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=CROSSOVER(SG1, 0)</span>. This checks for when the first study Subgraph crosses 0.</li>

        <li><b>Alert Formula For When 2 Study Subgraphs Cross</b>: The following  Simple Alert Condition Formula needs to be entered on one of the studies: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=CROSSOVER(ID#.SG1, ID#.SG1,)</span>.   <b>ID#</b> needs to be changed to the study ID  of the study being referred to. For information about study IDs, refer to  <a href="#ReferencingOtherStudies">Referencing Other Studies on the Chart</a>.</li>

        <li><b> Formula to Detect Swing High and Low</b>: The following Simple Alert Condition Formula is for the <b>Swing High and Low</b> study  when its <b>Length</b> input is set to 2. This will provide an alert whenever there is a Swing High or Low. Formula:  <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR(SG1 &gt; 0, SG2 &gt; 0, SG1[-1] &gt; 0, SG2[-1] &gt; 0, SG1[-2] &gt; 0, SG2[-2] &gt; 0, SG1[-3] &gt; 0, SG2[-3] &gt; 0)</span>.</li>

        <li><b>Alert Formula for When Bar Close Price Crosses over Top or Bottom Bollinger Band</b>: The following Simple Alert Condition Formula needs to be entered on the Bollinger Bands study:  <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR( CROSSFROMBELOW(C, SG1), CROSSFROMABOVE(C, SG3))</span>. This formula will give an alert when the bar closing price crosses from below the Top Band to above the Top Band or crosses  from above the Bottom to below the Bottom Band. You may optionally want to enable the <b>Evaluate on Bar Close</b> option on the <b>Alerts</b> tab of the Study Settings window.</li>

        <li> <b> Alert for Volume Greater Than Certain Volume</b>: Enter <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=V &gt; 10000</span> into the <b>Alerts</b> tab of the <b>Chart Settings</b> window.

        <li><b>Alert for Bar Time Duration  Equal to Specific Time</b>: Enter the following formula into the  <b>Alerts</b> tab of the  <b>Bar Time Duration</b> study: 
            <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=AND(SG1 &gt; TIME(0, 4, 59), SG1 &lt; TIME(0, 5, 1))</span>. This will provide an alert when  the time of a bar is five minutes. Since Date and Time values are imprecise floating-point values requires that we check for a range of up to one second on either side of five minutes. For this formula to work correctly it is necessary the <b>Value Format</b> setting for the study is set to <b>Time</b>. Reference: <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#TIME_Function">TIME Spreadsheet Function</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Moving Average Crossover With Arrows</b>: This is an example which uses Alert Condition Formulas and  <b>Color Bar Based on Alert Condition</b> studies to draw Up and Down arrows on the price bars  when long and short length <b>Moving Average-Exponential</b> studies cross. Click the following link to download the Study Collection file: <a href="../images/movingaveragecrossoverwitharrows.stdycollct">MovingAverageCrossoverWithArrows</a>.

This formula will provide an Alert when the difference between Ask Volume and Bid Volume is greater than 100 or less than -100. Modify the number 100 to use a different trigger value.</li>

        <li><b>Alert when Chart Bar is Within Specified Ticks of Touching Bollinger Bands</b>: Enter the following Alert Condition Formula on a Bollinger Bands study: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR(H &gt;= SG1 - (4 * TICKSIZE), L &lt;= SG3 + (4 * TICKSIZE))</span>. In this particular case the specified number of ticks is 4 and can be modified as required.</li>

        <li><b>Alert when High Crosses  Upper Bollinger Band or Low Crosses  Lower Bollinger Band</b>: Enter the following Alert Condition Formula on a Bollinger Bands study: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">OR( CROSSFROMBELOW(H, SG1), CROSSFROMABOVE(L, SG3))</span>. </li>

        <li><b>Alert when Close Within 25 Percent of Bottom of Chart Bar</b>: Enter the following Alert Condition Formula on a <b>Color Bar Based on Alert Condition</b> study: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">AND(C &gt;= L, C &lt;= ((H - L) * .25 + L) )</span>.</li>

        <li><b>Alert for where  Body of Candlestick Bar is Less Than 50 Percent of the High to Low Range of the Bar</b>: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">(ABS(O - C) / (H - L) &lt; .50)</span>. This formula can either be entered on the main price graph or on a study.</li>

        <li><b>Alert when High of the Current Bar Goes Higher than a Chart Drawing</b>: The Chart Drawing has a line ID of -40. Formula: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula"> H &gt; UDID[40][0]</span>.</li>
        
        <li> <b>Alert for when Last Trade Price is Within the High or Low of TPO Profile By 4 Ticks</b>: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">OR (C &gt;= H-TICKSIZE*4, C &lt;= L+TICKSIZE*4)</span>. Set this formula on the TPO Profile Chart study. <a href="#EnterAlertOnStudy " >Instructions</a>. </li>

        <li><b>Alert for When Close Crosses Into a Rectangle/Extending Rectangle Chart Drawing</b>: This formula is entered on the  <a href="#EnterAlertOnMainPriceGraph" >Main Price Graph</a>. The  Alert Formula checks for a cross from above for the first point (top value), and a cross from below for the second point (bottom value) of the Rectangle Chart Drawing. This assumes that the Rectangle Chart Drawing was entered with the first point higher than the second; if the Rectangle Chart Drawing was entered with the first point lower than the second, then the points would need to be reversed in the formula. Refer to <a href="#ReferencingChartDrawings">Referencing Chart Drawings</a> for more information. In this example, the Chart Drawing has an ID of 40 and is compared to the Close price: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">OR(CROSSFROMABOVE(C, UDID[40].A1), CROSSFROMBELOW(C, UDID[40].A2))</span>.</li>

        <li><b>Alert when Last price crosses over a Pivot Point study line</b>: <span class=SpreadsheetFormula>OR(CROSSOVER(C, SG13), CROSSOVER(C, SG1), CROSSOVER(C, SG2), CROSSOVER(C, SG3), CROSSOVER(C, SG4))</span>. This formula is entered on a Pivot Points study to alert when the Last price has crossed over any of the R2, R1, Pivot Point, S1, or S2 lines. The option <b>Reset Alert Condition on New Bar</b> should be selected in order to force the alert into a negative state when the next bar starts.</li>
