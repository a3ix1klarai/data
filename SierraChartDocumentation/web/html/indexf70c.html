    <p class="GeneralBackgroundHighlightLight">In recent versions of Sierra Chart we have renamed Workbook and Worksheet to <b>Spreadsheet</b>. The 3 Worksheet studies now have been renamed and begin with the name <b>Spreadsheet</b>. <b>Worksheet Study</b> has been renamed to <b>Spreadsheet Study</b>.  This documentation uses the term Spreadsheet. In the version of Sierra Chart you are running, you may refer to the study names beginning with the old name Worksheet.</p>

    <h2 id="GeneralInformation">General Information</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#GeneralInformation">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <a href="../images/spreadsheetsystemimage1.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/spreadsheetsystemimage1.png" alt="" class="MediumFloatRight"></a>
    <a href="../images/spreadsheetsystemimage2.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/spreadsheetsystemimage2.png" alt="" class="MediumFloatRight"></a>
    <a href="../images/spreadsheetsystemimage3.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/spreadsheetsystemimage3.png" alt="" class="MediumFloatRight"></a>

    <p>The <a href="#CreatingSystemAlert">Spreadsheet System/Alert</a> study and the <a href="#AutomatedTrading">Spreadsheet System for Trading</a> study  can be used to create a Trading System or an Alert for your chart. A trading system or an alert means rules that you define which will provide buy or sell signals when the rules are true for a particular bar in the chart. These signals will be shown as  graphical indications  on the chart, show text alert lines and give audible alerts. In the case of the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study, actual trade orders will also be given. An alert refers to the signal given when your System/Alert rules are true on the last bar. All of this is described in more detail below.</p>

    <p>If you are just interested in getting an alert when your condition is true at the end of the chart and you do not need to see historical graphical indications on the chart of this, then in most cases you can just simply use the <a href="index9fef.html?page=doc/StudyChartAlertsAndScanning.php#EnterAlertOnStudy">Simple Alert</a> feature. And not bother using the more advanced Spreadsheet studies.</p>

    <p>The difference between the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study as compared to the <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> study, is that the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study has much more advanced logic for creating a trading system.</p>

    <p>With with the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study you can perform back testing and generate actual trade signals either which will be simulated or can be sent to your trading service. By default they will always be simulated. Even if you do not actually want to place Live orders with the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study, and you just want to create a system and back test it, or just wish to place trades manually from it, you still will want to use the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study rather than the  <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> study.</p>

    <p>If you just simply want to create a simple System or advanced Alert to give you an indication when your rules return TRUE, then you will want to use the  <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> study.</p>


    <p>Creating a System/Alert is accomplished by entering  a <b>Condition Formula</b> in the formula columns on the Spreadsheet. This <b>Condition Formula</b> can access the price and study data (Study data is outputted beginning at column <b>AA</b> by default and depends on the <b>Number of Formula Columns</b> Input.).</p>

    <p>This Condition Formula will be applied across the entire price graph. It will be continuously monitored and also can be scanned for (you should not do automated trading from a scan).   This Condition Formula is used to give an indication of when a certain condition is TRUE for any chart column/bar. These indications are used to create a trading system or an alert.</p>

    <p>There is no difference between the way Sierra Chart does Systems and Alerts. Both give graphical, text, and audible indications when your Condition Formula is TRUE. Although, a text message, audible sound, and a trade signal, in the case of the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study,  are only given when a Condition Formula returns TRUE on the very last column in the chart.</p>

    <p>Also, when a Condition Formula is TRUE on the very last column in the chart, then an <b>!</b> mark will be displayed in front of the study name and the study name will be highlighted in red. The alert message text and the audible alert sound are what constitute an alert indication.</p>


    <p>In the case of the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study, a trade signal and an alert are not necessarily given when your Condition Formula in one of the Buy/Sell Entry/Exit formula columns returns TRUE on the last column in the chart. There is other logic that is applied and other conditions have to be met. All of this is explained on this page.</p>

    <p>Additionally, in the case of the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study,  if your Condition Formula returns TRUE on the last column in the chart, it will  be ignored if data is being downloaded into the chart or when the chart is fully recalculated. These are safety methods to prevent trades from being given unintentionally, in the case when Sierra Chart is not in Trade Simulation Mode.</p>

    <p>Sierra Chart provides a text alert for your Condition Formula when it becomes TRUE by adding a detailed message to the Alerts Log. To open the  Alerts Log, select <b class="menu_item">Window &gt;&gt; Alerts Manager &gt;&gt; Alerts Log</b> on the menu. If the condition is TRUE at a  chart column/bar other than the last chart column, then only a graphical indication is given.</p>

    <h2 id="CreatingSystemAlert">Creating a System or Alert</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#CreatingSystemAlert">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>This section applies to the <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> study.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Follow the step-by-step <a href="indexbc7b.html?page=doc/UsingTheSpreadsheetStudy.php#Instructions">Spreadsheet Study</a>  instructions.</p></li>

        <li><p>When following those instructions and  you get to the step to add the study to the chart, make sure you add the <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> study instead.</p></li>

        <li><p>When you get to the step where you enter a formula, enter your System/Alert Condition Formula instead. Refer to the <a href="#AutomatedTradingExample">Examples</a> section below for example <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> Condition Formulas.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>In the case of the <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> study, the formula results from the Spreadsheet will be displayed in the main price graph area (Chart Region 1) of the chart and drawn with Up/Down Arrow styles by default.  The Draw Style can be changed through the Subgraphs settings on the <b>Subgraphs</b> tab of the <b>Study Settings</b> window for the <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> study. For instructions, refer to <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#AddingModifyingStudies">Adding/Modifying studies</a>.</p>

    <p>The formulas on the Spreadsheet should return either a 1 (TRUE) or 0 (FALSE) value. A value of 1 or TRUE indicates the System/Alert formula condition has been met. For example: Enter <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=ID0.SG4@3 &lt; 100</span> in <em>row 3</em> of the K formula column to set up a Long Entry alert when the closing price is less than 100.</p>

    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id="LongEntry">Long Entry Column</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#LongEntry">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p> The <b>K</b> column is the <b>Long Entry</b> column. If a cell in this column is TRUE (1), then an  <b>Up Arrow</b> (depends upon the Subgraph Draw Style) will be drawn on the chart at the  <em>low value</em> of the corresponding bar to indicate a Long Entry for that bar.</p>

        <p>Although any value other than 0 is considered a TRUE condition, the position of the <b>Up Arrow</b> is handled as a special case when the cell has a value of <b>1</b>. Any other value will draw the <b>Up Arrow</b> at the value given in the cell. It is recommended to only use <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> for cells in this column.</p>

        <h3 id="LongExit">Long Exit Column</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#LongExit">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>The <b>L</b> column is the <b>Long Exit</b> column. If a cell in this column is TRUE (1), then a <b>Left Arrow</b> (depends upon the Subgraph Draw Style) will be drawn on the chart at the <em>high value</em> of the corresponding bar to indicate a Long Exit for that bar.</p>

        <p>Although any value other than 0 is considered a TRUE condition, the position of the <b>Left Arrow</b> is handled as a special case when the cell has a value of <b>1</b>. Any other value will draw the <b>Left Arrow</b> at the value given in the cell. It is recommended to only use <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> for cells in this column.</p>
    </section>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ShortEntry">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>The <b>M</b> column is the <b>Short Entry</b> column . If a cell in this column is TRUE (1), then a <b> Down Arrow </b> (depends upon the Subgraph Draw Style) will be drawn on the chart at the <em>high value</em> of the corresponding bar to indicate a Short Entry.</p>

        <p>Although any value other than 0 is considered a TRUE condition, the position of the <b>Down Arrow</b> is handled as a special case when the cell has a value of <b>1</b>. Any other value will draw the <b>Down Arrow</b> at the value given in the cell. It is recommended to only use <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> for cells in this column.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id="ShortExit">Short Exit Column</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ShortExit">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>The <b>N</b> column is the <b>Short Exit</b> column. If a cell in this column is TRUE (1), then an <b>Right  Arrow</b> (depends upon the Subgraph Draw Style) will be drawn on the chart at the <em>low value</em> of the bar to indicate a Short Exit.</p>

        <p>Although any value other than 0 is considered a TRUE condition, the position of the <b>Right Arrow</b> is handled as a special case when the cell has a value of <b>1</b>. Any other value will draw the <b>Right Arrow</b> at the value given in the cell. It is recommended to only use <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> for cells in this column.</p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SystemAlertOtherFormulaColumns">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>When graphing columns other than <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, or <b>N</b> with a visible Draw Style, the return value of the Condition Formula must be within the range of values of the main price graph your study is overlaid on. Otherwise, the subgraph display will adversely affect the display of the chart.</p>

        <p>There is no automatic translation from TRUE (1) or FALSE (0) to high and low bar values, from the formula columns <b>O</b> and higher.</p>

        <p>An example formula that you can use for formula columns <b>O</b> and higher is <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=IF(ID0.SG4@3 &gt; 100, C3, 0)</span>.</p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ChangingColumnNames">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>The above are the default System/Alert formula column names. You can rename the columns at row 2 in the Sheet and use them for any kind of condition. To rename a column, click two times on the cell with the name in row  2 and type a new name.</p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ControllingTheLocationOfArrowsOrSubgraphValues">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>You can also return values other than TRUE (1) or FALSE (0) in your System/Alert Condition Formulas. This can be done by using the <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#IF_Function" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IF</a> function. For example: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=IF([formula expression], D3, 0)</span>. This will return the low value of the chart bar. <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=IF([formula expression], C3 ,0)</span>. This will return the high value of the chart bar.</p>

        <p>If the value returned by the formula is not TRUE (1) or FALSE (0), then the arrow will be drawn at the value the formula returns when using columns <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, or <b>N</b> when using the <b> Spreadsheet System/Alert </b> study.</p>

        <p>For formula columns <b>O</b> and higher, the Subgraph arrows or whatever the  <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#DrawStyle" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subgraph Draw Style</a> is, will always be drawn at the value returned from the formula.</p>

            <li>Select <span class="GeneralBackgroundHighlight"><b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b></span> in the <b>Studies Available</b> list on the left. <em>Do not confuse this study</em> with the <b>Spreadsheet Study</b> or the  <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> studies. </li>

            <li>Press the <b>Add</b> button to add the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study to the <b>Studies to Graph</b> list.</li>

            <li>For this example, also add the study named <b>Moving Average-Simple</b>. You do not need to change the settings for this study, the defaults are acceptable. We will create a system that will Buy when the current price moves above a moving average and Sell when the current price moves below a moving average. This is only intended as an example in these instructions. This is not necessarily a practical trading system for actual use.
                <br> <br>
                If you want to make a system different than this example by using other studies, <em>add</em> them to the chart now if you have not already added them. Adjust the settings as you require them for each study.
            </li>

            <li>Highlight the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study in the <b>Studies to Graph</b> list box.  Press the <b>Settings</b> button. In the <b>Technical Study Settings</b> window on the <b>Settings And Inputs</b> tab, there is a text box for the <b>Spreadsheet Name</b> (lower left). Enter a name in the text box without a file extension. This is the name of the Spreadsheet that will be opened or created to contain the data and formulas. The name should be related to what your custom system will do.</li>

            <li>To have the orders sent to the Sierra Chart internal Trade Simulation system, the <b>Send Orders To Trade Service</b> Input needs to be set to <b>No</b>. To send order signals to the connected Trading service, the <b>Send Orders To Trade Service</b> Input needs to be set to <b>Yes</b> and you also need to disable <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Simulation Mode On</b> on the menu. For complete details, refer to <a href="index1794.html?page=doc/AutoTradeManagment.php#SendOrdersToTradeService" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SendOrdersToTradeService</a>.</li>

            <li>In the study Inputs list, you will find an Input named <b>Maximum Position Allowed </b>. Set this Input as you require. It is the maximum Position in shares or contracts that is allowed.  For complete details, refer to <a href = "index1794.html?page=doc/AutoTradeManagment.php#MaximumPositionAllowed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximum Position Allowed</a>.</li>

            <li>The other inputs are correct as they are for this example. For more information about all of the inputs, refer to <a href="#SystemInputs"> Inputs That Are Specific to Systems, Alerts, and Automated Trading</a>.</li>

            <li>In the list of available study Inputs you will see inputs named <b>Column K-Z Alert</b>. Set these to the Alert Sound Number you want to hear when your System/Alert Condition Formula in the corresponding column becomes TRUE at the last bar. For more information,   refer to <a href="#AlertSound">Sound for Audible Alert and E-Mail Message Notifications</a>.</li>

            <li>Press the <b>OK</b> button on the <b>Technical Study Settings</b> window.</li>

            <li>Press the <b>OK</b> button on the <b>Chart Studies</b> window.</li>

            <li>The Spreadsheet will be opened in the background. Go to it by selecting <b class="menu_item">CW</b> on the menu. The name of the spreadsheet will be listed and can be selected. The name will be what you have specified in the <b>Study Settings </b> window for the study. </li>
            <li>
                A Spreadsheet contains multiple  <b>Sheets</b>. The Sheet number the data is outputted to, is the same Sheet number as the chart number. For example, chart #2 will be outputted to <b>Sheet2</b> in the Spreadsheet.
                <br> <br>
                The Sheet can be selected with the list box at the top left of the Spreadsheet. All of the individual chart studies are also outputted to the same Sheet beginning at column AA (the default when using 16 formula columns).</li>

            <li>Select the  <b>Sheet#</b> from the list box at the top left of the Spreadsheet window that corresponds to the Chart Number that contains the <b> Spreadsheet System for Trading </b> study.  </li>  

            <li>Set <a href="#CellJ26_OrderQuantity">cell J26 (<b>Order Quantity</b>)</a> to the number of shares or contracts you want to  trade when an order is submitted. If this order quantity cell is set to 0, then in the case of a Buy Entry or Sell Entry,  it will be interpreted  as a quantity of 1.</li>

            <li>All new orders use the settings of the Trade Window for the chart. 
                <br> <br>
                Go to the chart that contains the  <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading </b> study. Select <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt;  Attach Trade Window  to Chart</b> to see what the settings are set to. 
                <br><br>
                For example, if the <b> Time in Force </b> is set to <b>Day</b>, then all new orders submitted from the Spreadsheet will automatically have a <b>Time in Force</b> of <b>Day</b>. 
                <br> <br>
                The settings that you can set in the Trade Window also include Attached Orders.  For complete instructions for Attached Orders, refer to the <a href="index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attached Orders</a> page.</li>
                <li>  On  the  attached Trade Window, set the  <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#SelectingTradeAccount" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade Account</a>  to the trading account that you want to use. </li>

            <li>The following steps provide an example of a trading system using Spreadsheet formulas. <a href="#BuyEntry">Buy Entry</a> and <a href="#SellEntry">Sell Entry</a> formulas are given.</li>

            <li>To Buy when the Last price crosses from below the moving average, type in cell <b>K3</b> (labeled: <b>Buy Entry</b>):
                <br><br>
                <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=CROSSFROMBELOW(ID0.SG4@3:ID0.SG4@4, ID2.SG1@3:ID2.SG1@4)</span>
                <br><br>
                Where <b>ID0.SG4@3:ID0.SG4@4</b> refers to the current and previous last trade prices of the chart bars and <b>ID2.SG1@3:ID2.SG1@4</b> refers to the current and previous <b>Moving Average - Simple</b> study values which are located in column <b>AA </b>. In all places in the example formulas on this page, <b>ID2</b> may need to be changed to the actual ID# number used by the <b>Moving Average</b> study. You can see the actual ID# number in row 1 in the column that the study is outputted to. Refer to the image below:
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/studyidnumberonspreadsheet.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/studyidnumberonspreadsheet.png" alt="" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" ></a></div>
                <br><br>
                You can also optionally use: 
                <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=AND(CROSSFROMBELOW(ID0.SG4@3:ID0.SG4@4, ID2.SG1@3:ID2.SG1@4), $J$8=0)</span>
                <br><br>
                <b>$J$8</b> is the current Trade Position quantity. This can be used to check the Position is flat before entering the market. The underlying automated trading logic checks this, but it can be checked in your formula to avoid unnecessary messages to the  <b Class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Service Log</b>. The disadvantage is that you cannot see on the chart your historical buy and sell signal arrows without running a back test.
            </li>

            <li> For an understanding of references like <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">ID2.SG4@3</span>, refer to <a href="indexdf54.html?page=doc/WorkingWithSpreadsheets.php#ReferencesStudySubgraphColumnsSpreadsheetStudy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">References to Study Subgraph Columns when using the Spreadsheet Study</a>.</li>

            <li>To Sell when the Last price crosses from above the moving average, type in cell <b>M3</b> (labeled: <b>Sell Entry</b>): 
                <br><br>
                <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=CROSSFROMABOVE(ID0.SG4@3:ID0.SG4@4, ID2.SG1@3:ID2.SG1@4)</span>
                <br> <br>
                Where <b>ID0.SG4@3:ID0.SG4@4</b> refers to the current and previous last trade prices of the chart bars and <b>ID2.SG1@3:ID2.SG1@4</b> refers to the current and previous <b>Moving Average - Simple</b> values which are located in column <b>AA</b>.
                <br> <br>
                You can also optionally use: 
                <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=AND(CROSSFROMBELOW( ID0.SG4@3:ID0.SG4@4, ID2.SG1@3:ID2.SG1@4), $J$8=0)</span>
                <br><br>
                <b>$J$8</b> is the current Trade Position quantity.  This can be used to check the Position is flat before entering the market. The underlying automated trading logic checks this, but it can be checked in your formula to avoid unnecessary messages to the  <b Class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Service Log</b>. The disadvantage is that you cannot see on the chart your historical buy and sell signal arrows without running a back test.
            </li>

            <li>Using these formulas, when the Last price crosses from below the moving average, <b>K3</b> (<b>Buy Entry</b>) will trigger a Buy order, and when the Last price crosses from above the moving average, <b>M3</b> (<b>Sell Entry</b>) will trigger a Sell order.
                <br> <br>
                By default, only one order can be sent until a corresponding Exit signal is given.  Therefore, if there has already been a Buy Entry, then all other Buy Entry signals are ignored until the  <b>Buy Exit</b> formula becomes TRUE and triggers a Sell  or the Position is flattened by another method. 
                <br> <br>
                If there has already been a Sell Entry, then all other Sell Entry signals are ignored until the  <b>Sell Exit</b> formula becomes TRUE and triggers a Buy or the Short Position is flattened by another method.  
                <br> <br>
                This behavior is controlled with the <a href="index1794.html?page=doc/AutoTradeManagment.php#AllowMultipleEntriesInSameDirection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allow Multiple Entries In Same Direction</a> Input.  If the <b> Allow Opposite Entry with Opposing Position or Orders </b> Input is set to <b>Yes</b>, which is the default, then if there currently is a  Long Position, then a Sell Entry can exit that Position. The same with a Short Position and Buy Entry.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you have multiple conditions for your trading system, then you will need to use the <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#AvailableFunctions"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AND()</a> function. For example, if you have a <b>RSI (Relative Strength Index)</b> study on the chart and the data is outputted to column AC on the Sheet, and you want to combine that with the Moving Average study, use a formula similar to this for the Buy Entry: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=AND(CROSSFROMBELOW(ID0.SG4@3:ID0.SG4@4,  ID2.SG1@3:ID2.SG1@4), ID3.SG1@3 &lt; 40)</span>. <b>ID3.SG1@3</b> references the RSI study assuming it has a study ID of 3.
                <br> <br>

            <li>In this example we will create a <span class="GeneralBackgroundHighlightLight"><a href="#BuyExit">Buy Exit (Sell)</a></span> that exits a Position when a Stop or Target value is reached. A <b>Buy Exit</b> is optional.  A <b>Sell Entry</b> could close out a Position created by a <b>Buy Entry</b>. Or, the Position can be closed out <a href="#UsingManualOrAttachedOrdersExits">manually or with an Attached Order</a>. In this example, we are using a <b>Buy Exit</b> formula to show you an exit strategy managed completely by the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study.
                <br> <br>
                In cell <b>L3</b> (labeled: <b>Buy Exit</b>), type <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR(AND($J$8 &gt; 0, ID0.SG4@$3 &lt;= $J$9-1), AND($J$8 &gt; 0, ID0.SG4@$3 &gt;= $J$9+2))</span>. <b>ID0.SG4@$3</b> refers to the Last price of the most recent chart bar, <b>$J$8</b> refers to the current Position Quantity, and <b>$J$9</b> refers to the current Position Average Price. 
                <br> <br>
                When this formula in cell <b>L3</b> returns TRUE, it will trigger a Sell order. What this formula means is that when there is a <em>Long Position</em> <b>AND</b> the last price is less than the price the  <b>Buy Entry</b> was filled at minus 1 full point (Stop), <b>OR</b> there is a <em>Long Position</em> <b>AND</b> the last price is greater than the price the <b>Buy Entry</b> was filled at plus 2 full points (Limit), then return TRUE. This will cause a Sell order to be placed.   This is just an example and you need to use what is appropriate in your specific case.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Note</b>: It is essential that the formula contains a check that there is a Position &gt; 0.  This is explained in more detail in the <a href="#BuyExit">Buy Exit</a> section.
                <br> <br>
                The <b>$</b> means a cell reference refers to an absolute cell and the column and row will not be adjusted when the formula is automatically filled down. This formula is relevant only to the topmost row in the Spreadsheet (corresponds to the last bar in the chart), even though it is applied to historical bars as well.  Refer to the <a href="#SpecialOutputtedValues">Special Spreadsheet Outputted Values</a> section for more information on the data in the <b>J</b> column.
                <br> <br>
                <div class="YellowHighlightNoBorder">When entering numbers and formulas, keep in mind to use the proper delimiters in the numbers and formulas, according  to the <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Spreadsheet Settings &gt;&gt; Decimal and Function Delimiters</b> setting.  For more information, refer to the <a href="indexdf54.html?page=doc/WorkingWithSpreadsheets.php#Delimiters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decimal and Function Delimiters</a> section.</div></li>

            <li>In this example we will create a <span class="GeneralBackgroundHighlightLight"><a href="#SellExit">Sell Exit (Buy)</a></span>  that exits a Position when a Stop or Target is reached. A <b>Sell Exit</b> is optional.  A <b>Buy Entry</b> could close out a Position created by a <b>Sell Entry</b>. Or, the Position can be closed out <a href="#UsingManualOrAttachedOrdersExits">manually or with an Attached Order</a>. In this example, we are using a <b>Sell Exit</b> to show you an exit strategy managed completely by the  <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study.
                <br> <br>
                In cell <b>N3</b> (labeled: Sell Exit), type <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR(AND($J$8 &lt; 0, ID0.SG4@$3 &gt;= $J$9+1), AND($J$8 &lt; 0, ID0.SG4@$3 &lt;= $J$9-2))</span>. <b>ID0.SG4@$3</b> refers to the Last price of the most recent chart bar, <b>$J$8</b> refers to the Position Quantity, and <b>$J$9</b> refers to the Position Average Price. 
                <br> <br>
                When this formula in cell <b>N3</b> returns TRUE, it will send a Buy order. What this formula means is that when there is a short Position <b>AND</b> the last price is greater than the price the <b>Sell Entry</b> was filled at plus 1 full point (Stop), <b>OR</b> there is a short Position <b>AND</b> the last price is less than the  price the <b>Sell Entry</b> was filled at minus 2 full points (Limit), then return TRUE. This will cause a Buy order to be placed. This is just an example and you need to use what is appropriate in your specific case.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Note</b>: It is essential that the formula contains a check that there is a Position &lt; 0.  This is explained in more detail in the <a href="#SellExit">Sell Exit</a> section.
                <br> <br>
                The <b>$</b> means a cell reference refers to an absolute cell and the column and row will not be adjusted when the formula is filled down. This formula is relevant only to the topmost row in the Spreadsheet (corresponds to the last bar in the chart), even though it is applied to historical bars as well. Refer to the <a href="#SpecialOutputtedValues">Special Spreadsheet Outputted Values</a> section for more information on the data in the <b>J</b> column.</li>

            <li><b>Note:</b> In the case of actual live trading, these Stops and Targets are sent by Sierra Chart to the connected trading service when the conditions are met. This is necessary in order to accomplish advanced exit strategies. Although these are not advanced exit strategies, we demonstrate how you can do advanced exit strategies.</li>

            <li>In order for an order to be placed as fast as possible, it is a good idea to make sure the <b> Chart Update Interval</b>, which is set through <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Settings</b> on the menu, is set to 800  milliseconds or less. However, avoid making it very small unless your computer is very fast. 
            <br> <br>
            This setting can be changed for an individual chart instead of globally, refer to <a href="index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#ChartUpdateInterval"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chart Update Interval</a>.</li>

            <li>You can also use  <b>Attached Orders</b> for exiting a Position. Refer to <a href="#UsingManualOrAttachedOrdersExits">Initiating Trades with Auto-Trading and Using Manual or Attached Orders Exits</a>.</li>

            <li>Now that we have entered the Spreadsheet formulas on the Spreadsheet, it is necessary to go back to the chart.  Select <b class = "menu_item">CW</b> on the menu and select the chart that you applied the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study to, or select it from the <a href="index69b6.html?page=doc/WorkingWithCharts.html#SelectingCharts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chart window tabs</a> which are located at either the top or bottom of the main window.  
            <br> <br>
            To ensure the formulas that have been entered are fully copied down the formula columns (K through Z) on the Spreadsheet, select <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Recalculate</b> on the menu.
            <br> <br>
            Selecting this command is <em>not necessary</em> if <b class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Spreadsheet Settings</b> <b> &gt;&gt; Recalculate the Chart when a Formula Column is Changed</b> is enabled.
            </li>
            
            
            

            <li>Refer to the Buy and Sell arrows on the chart. These arrows represent the TRUE values returned from the <b>Buy Entry</b> and <b>Sell Entry</b>  Condition Formulas in the formula columns. By default the Subgraph <b>Draw Style</b>  for the Exit  columns (L and N) are set to  <b>Hidden</b>, so they do not appear. 
            <br> <br>
            Understand that these do not represent actual submitted orders or order fills. There is an important difference. Refer to <a href="#IgnoredSignalsBuySellArrowsDoNotMeanTradeSignals">Buy/Sell Arrows Do Not Mean Trade Signals</a> for more information.</li>

            <li>In this example, we use exits which are based upon <b>Trade Position</b> data which is only known for the  <em>current Trade Position</em>, so the Buy/Sell arrows are not relevant historically. If the exit formulas were based upon the price and/or study data, then you could set the corresponding Exit columns to a visible  <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#DrawStyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Draw Style</a>.</li>

            <li>Make certain there is a check mark by <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Auto Trading Enabled - Global</b>   and <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Auto Trading Enabled - Chart</b> so the TRUE results that your Condition Formulas provide, will be able to submit  Trade Orders and not be ignored.</li>

            <li>As the chart is updated, either with real-time streaming data received from the connected data feed, or during a <a href="index9600.html?page=doc/ReplayChart.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chart replay</a>, the Buy Entry, Buy Exit, Sell Entry, Sell Exit formulas at row 3   when they become TRUE/1 will cause Trade Orders to be submitted, either in Trade Simulation Mode or to the connected Trading service.
            <br> <br>
            These signals also produce Alert Messages and these can be viewed by selecting <b class="menu_item">Window &gt;&gt;  Alerts Manager &gt;&gt; Alerts Log</b> on the menu.</li>
            
            <li>There are various conditions which can cause the TRUE/1 formula results to become ignored and not result in Trade Orders from being submitted. For complete details, refer to <a href="#IgnoredSignalsWithSpreadsheetSystemsOrAlerts">Ignored Signals With Spreadsheet Systems or Alerts</a>. This is an essential section to read over.</li>
            
            <li>It is important to understand that <a href="#IgnoredSignalsBuySellArrowsDoNotMeanTradeSignals">Buy/Sell Arrows Do Not Mean Trade Signals</a></li>

            <li>To view the submitted Trade Orders, select <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log  &gt;&gt; Trade Activity</b> on the menu. For detailed  documentation, refer to <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viewing Historical Trade Activity Log</a>. </li>

            <li>To view the Trade Service Log, select <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Service Log</b> on the menu.  The <b>Trade Service Log</b> displays ignored signals from your Condition Formulas. </li>

            <li>The next step is to simply watch your system perform in real-time as your chart is updated. Or perform  <a href="indexe891.html?page=doc/Backtesting.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back Testing</a>. Back Testing is a very good way to test your trading system on historical data and get a good understanding of it. 
            <br> <br>
            There is no other way to test the trading system on historical chart data other than through Back Testing or a  <a href="index9600.html?page=doc/ReplayChart.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chart replay</a>.  The buy and sell arrows you see on the chart <a href="#IgnoredSignalsBuySellArrowsDoNotMeanTradeSignals" >do not actually represent submitted Trade Orders</a>.  Order Actions will only happen through a Back Test, during a chart replay or during real-time updating of the chart.</li>

    <p>You can specify an alert sound to be played when the System or Alert condition in cells K3 through Z3 become TRUE. For the formulas in the Sheet to trigger sound alerts requires enabling them.</p>

    <p>Go to the <b>Study Settings</b> window for your <b>Spreadsheet Study</b>. For instructions, refer to <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#AddingModifyingStudies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modifying Studies</a>. Keep in mind, that after a Spreadsheet Study is applied to a chart it changes its name in the <b>Studies to Graph</b> list on the <b>Chart Studies</b> window to the name of the Spreadsheet file it references. </p>

    <p> On the <b>Settings and Inputs </b> tab of the Study Settings window you will see a list of all of the available study Inputs.  You will see several inputs named <b>Column K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V-Z Alert</b> that will let you select the <b>Alert Sound Number</b> to be used for each column.  </p>

    <p>Select the <b>Alert Sound Number</b> that you want to use, or select <b>No Alert</b> to not play an alert sound when a formula becomes TRUE in cells K3 through Z3. Sheet columns W through Z use the same alert sound number as column V.  </p>

    <p>To set the sound file that plays for each alert number, select <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; <a href="index899f.html?page=doc/GeneralSettings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Settings</a></b> on the menu. You can also setup an email message to be sent when an alert sound is triggered.</p>

    <p>If the <b>Draw Style</b> for a Sheet column is set to <b>Ignore</b>, then no System or Alert signals can be triggered by the Sheet formulas. However, this does not apply to column K through N when using the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study. With that study, Trade signals can always be triggered by the Sheet formulas regardless of the <b>Draw Style</b> setting.</p>

    <p>It is not necessary to use the <b>Buy Exit</b> or <b>Sell Exit</b> Order Action formula cells in the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study to exit a current Position.  Exits can be done by manually entering an order through the <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade Window</a>, through <a href="index3c50.html?page=doc/ChartTrading.html" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chart Trading</a>, or can be performed by using the <a href="index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attached Orders</a> feature (Targets and Stops).  </p>

    <p>In any of these cases, you can then optionally leave the <b>Buy Exit</b> or <b>Sell Exit</b> Order Action formula cells blank.</p>

    <p> Target and Stop orders are configured through the Trade Window on the <b>Targets</b> tab. For complete documentation,  refer to the <a href="index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attached Orders</a> page. </p>

    <p> When using Attached Orders, make sure that <a href="index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html#UseAttachedOrdersforNewOrders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use Attached Orders</a> is enabled on the Trade Window for the chart containing the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study.

    <p>The set of Attached Orders which is entered on the Trade Window  for a chart is saved when a Chartbook is saved.</p>
    
    <p>It is fully supported to adjust both the Target Order offset and Stop Order offset through Sheet cells when using a single Target and Stop   <a href = "index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html">Attached Orders</a> on the Trade Window.   Refer to  <a href = "#CellJ80_AttachedOrderTargetOffset">Attached Order Target Offset</a> and  <a href = "#CellJ81_AttachedOrderStopOffset">Attached Order Stop Offset</a>.  </p>

    <p>Orders that are given by the <b>Buy Exit</b> or <b>Sell Exit</b> Order Action  formula cells will not use the Attached Orders configured in the Trade Window. Only <b>Buy Entry</b> and <b>Sell Entry</b> will use them when <b>Use Attached Orders </b> is enabled on the Trade Window.</p>

    <p>When you are using the automated trading functionality in Sierra Chart, it is recommended that you always enter and cancel any manual orders from within Sierra Chart  to avoid any unexpected auto trade issues due to Sierra Chart  not being aware of the Orders and Trade Position changes you do from other trading programs.</p>

    <p>You may want to enter a Position manually and then have an automated Position exit based upon certain technical conditions which can be based upon the price and study data.  This is accomplished by using the <b> Spreadsheet System for Trading </b> study.  Refer to the <a href="#AutomatedTrading">Creating a Trading System for Automated Trading</a>  instructions on this page to use this study and define your exit conditions. The study will need to be applied to a chart of the same symbol that you are trading.</p>

    <p>When you use the <b> Spreadsheet System for Trading </b> study for this purpose, you will not use the <b>Buy Entry</b> and <b>Sell Entry</b> Order Action columns.  These columns need to be left blank.  Any steps in the instructions associated with them can be skipped. You will only use the <b>Buy Exit</b> and <b>Sell Exit</b>  Order Action columns.</p>

    <p><b>Spreadsheet System for Trading </b> study Inputs related to <b>Buy Entry</b> and <b>Sell Entry</b> will not apply for your automated exit strategy.</p>

    <p>When either the  <b>Buy Exit</b> or <b>Sell Exit</b> Order Action columns become  TRUE, an order will be submitted at that time.  This can be any of the order types supported by the  <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study.  Only when your Exit condition is met, will the order be submitted, not before. Therefore, it is not possible to submit a Stop or Limit order ahead of time and modify it.  Therefore, Sierra Chart needs to be running to monitor your current Position and submit the orders. It is possible to use the <a href="index2bf5.html?page=doc/ACSILTrading.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACSIL Trading</a> functions and modify an order that has been submitted.</p>

    <p>This section lists Inputs for the Spreadsheet Studies which are specific to the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading </b> and the <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> studies. These inputs  can only be set through the <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#AddingModifyingStudies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Study Settings</a> window for the Spreadsheet studies.</p>

    <p>For the other available Spreadsheet Study Inputs which are set through the <b>Study Settings</b> window, refer to the <a href="index2192.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetStudyInputs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spreadsheet Study Inputs</a> page.</p>

    <p>A <em>Read-only</em> display of some of these Study Inputs is displayed on the Spreadsheet Sheet that the chart data is outputted to in <em>cell columns I and J</em>. It is <em>not</em>  possible to modify the value of these Inputs through the Sheet cells.  They can only be set through the <b>Study Settings</b> window for the Spreadsheet study.</p>

        <p>If this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, then a System or Alert signal will be given when a new bar is added to the chart and the System/Alert condition is TRUE at row 3 even though the System/Alert condition was previously TRUE on the prior bar/row. </p>
        
        <p>Normally, when a formula returns TRUE or a nonzero value in one of the Spreadsheet columns used for Systems or Alerts and a new bar is added, a new signal will not be given even if it still TRUE. It will have to go back to FALSE and then back to  TRUE again, unless <b>Reset Condition On New Bar</b> is set to Yes. </p>
        
        <p>Setting <b>Reset Condition On New Bar</b> to Yes does not in any way change the values returned from the formulas in the  Buy/Sell Entry and Exit columns.   It only  affects the interpretation of the TRUE values returned.</p>

        <p>If the <b>Alert/Signal Only Once Per Bar</b> option is set to <b>Yes</b>, then an alert or trading signal will be given only once per Formula Column per bar in the chart.</p>

        <p>When an alert or trading is given once for a specific Spreadsheet Formula  Column, then another will not be given until there is a new bar in the chart <em>and</em> the System/Alert Condition Formula goes back to FALSE and then to  TRUE. </p> 

        <p>This applies to each formula column independently.  For example, in the case of the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study, if there is a Buy Entry at a particular bar, there can still be a Buy Exit given at the same bar. However, there cannot be 2  Buy Entries on the same bar when this option is enabled.</p> 

        <p>It is recommended that if you have any trouble obtaining a trading signal when you normally would expect one, that you try setting this option to <b>No</b>.</p>

        <p>In the case of the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study, when a signal is ignored because of this option, that ignored signal will be logged in the <b class = "menu_item">Trade  &gt;&gt; Trade Service Log</b>. This is very helpful for troubleshooting purposes. The message is: <em><b>Signal ignored because 'Signal Only Once Per Bar' is enabled and a signal was already given from formula column for bar.</b></em> </p>

        <p>When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b>,  Sheet formulas that return a non-zero (TRUE) value at row 3 in the corresponding formula columns are ignored until the last bar closes. The way this is accomplished is row 4 is monitored instead of row 3. </p>

        <p>When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b>, then anywhere in the documentation  row 3 is mentioned, it is row 4 instead.  In the same way that row 3 is continuously monitored for TRUE results from formulas in the corresponding formula columns, row 4 will be continuously monitored when this Input is set to Yes.</p>

        <p>You may want to set <a href = "#StrictSignalOnlyOnBarClose">Strict Signal Only On Bar Close Evaluation</a> to Yes, when you set one of these inputs to Yes.</p>

        <p>There is one scenario that you should keep in mind about when using <b>Signal Only on Bar Close</b>. Consider you have a formula and one of the Sheet formula columns and it returns TRUE at row 3 (the last bar of the chart) in the column. You refer to the arrow on the chart. A new bar is added, the bar therefore is considered closed,  the formula moves down to row 4, it is no longer TRUE and the arrow disappears. </p>

        <p>In this case when you are using <a href="#SignalOnlyonBarClose">Signal Only on Bar Close</a>, you will not get a signal.</p>

        <p>When using the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study and a formula returns TRUE/1 in the Buy Entry (K3), Buy Exit (L3), Sell Entry (M3), or Sell Exit (N3)  cells, a trade signal is not necessarily going to be given.   </p>
        
        <p>You will see an arrow above or below the chart bar corresponding  to the particular formula column cell indicating a buy or sell signal  based upon that TRUE/1 value, assuming the  corresponding Subgraph <b>Draw Style</b> is set to a visible style.  For example, if cell K5 is 1 in the Sheet being used by the  <b>Spreadsheet  Study</b>  and the   Buy Entry  <b>Subgraph  &gt;&gt; Draw Style </b> is set to  <b>Arrow Up</b>, then you would see an up arrow displayed below the third chart bar from the last bar in the chart.</p>

        <p>However, this does not necessarily mean that the formula TRUE/1 result will be followed and a trade signal will be given. The <a href="#ColumnSignalTypes">BuyEntry (K), BuyExit (L), SellEntry (M), SellExit (N) Spreadsheet Order Action Columns</a> rules must be met and the additional conditions imposed by the  related study <a href="#SystemInputs" >Input Settings</a> must be met, for a trade signal to be actually given.

        <p>If a TRUE signal has been given by the formula in a particular cell and then it goes back to FALSE and back to TRUE on the same bar, you will <em>not</em> get a signal if the study Input <b>Signal Only Once Per Bar</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>.</p>
        
        <p>One scenario to be aware of, is that a Buy/Sell Exit signal is given  when there is not  currently an existing Trade Position, and then there is an Entry on the same bar and then a  Buy/Sell Exit on that same bar again. In the case of when  <b>Signal Only Once Per Bar</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>, that second  Buy/Sell Exit is going to get ignored.

        <p>Therefore, you need to program the formula to remain FALSE until there is a Trade Position Quantity. This can be done by using the AND function and checking that cell <a href="#CellJ5_PositionQuantity" >J5</a> is nonzero.</p>

    <h2 id="DisappearingArrows">Disappearing Arrows or Signals</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#DisappearingArrows">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>When using either the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study or the <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> study, when a formula in a cell in one of the Spreadsheet columns that is graphed on the chart, typically this is going to be Spreadsheet columns K, L, M, N, returns a nonzero or <b>TRUE</b> value, you will see an arrow on the corresponding bar on the chart representing the  TRUE condition.</p>

    <p>You also need to make certain that the   <b>Draw Style</b> for the particular Spreadsheet formula column you want to see arrows for, is set to one of the <b>Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right</b> Draw Styles or other similar style. </p>

    <p>These TRUE formula signals can trigger an Alert Sound as well and also a Trade signal (in the case of the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study) if these signals are given in row 3, or row 4 if have set the study Input <b>Signal Only On Bar Close (Columns K,M)/(Columns L,N-Z)</b> to <b>Yes</b>. </p>

    <p>If the formula no longer is returning a nonzero or TRUE value and instead returning FALSE (0), then the arrow will <em>disappear</em> even though the Alert and the Trade signal was previously given.</p>

    <p> So it is important to understand  that your formula could go to TRUE momentarily and then FALSE. </p>

    <p>In summary, the standard Up and Down arrows on a chart displayed by these Spreadsheet studies and the result of formulas in cells K3, L3, M3, N3  (or at row 4), indicate the <em>present</em> state of the formulas. During the formation of a bar or after new bars are added to the chart, a formula could go from TRUE (1) to FALSE (0) based upon the logic of the formula and changing data in the cells that it references. It is up to you to determine specifically what is happening and why. </p>

    <p>To actually see where the trades were made, you need to display  <a href="index3c50.html?page=doc/ChartTrading.html#DisplayingOrderFills"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Order Fills</a> on the chart. You can also refer to the  <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade Activity Log</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are using the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study and you wish to visibly see where trades have been made on the chart in the case of when the arrows on the chart disappear, then enable <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Show Order Fills</b>. Various options affecting the display of order fills can be set by  enabling <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Chart Trade Settings</b> on the menu. </p>


    <p>When a cell that can trigger an Alert Sound or Trade signal becomes TRUE and an Alert Sound and/or a Trade signal is actually given, then  an alert message will be added to the <b class="menu_item">Window &gt;&gt; Show/Hide Alerts  Manager &gt;&gt; Alerts Log</b>. All of these events are logged in the <b>Alerts Log</b> tab.</p>

    <p>Not only can you experience the condition where the arrows disappear, you could also have the condition where the state of your formulas change,  based upon how they are programmed and the data they are referencing, and you see an arrow later appear on a bar where a signal was not previously given when it was evaluated for an alert or trade signal.</p>  

    <p>You may also see that the arrow direction does not correspond  to an order fill displayed on a bar due to changes with the formula results during processing of a bar.   For example, initially a bar may have given a Buy signal, a  Buy fill is displayed on the chart for the bar, but then later the bar gives a Sell signal which is ignored based upon the auto trade logic.  So at the present moment you see a Down Arrow, but a Buy fill for the bar.</p>

    <p>In order to create more stability when it comes to generating orders when using the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading </b> study, you may want to set the <b>Signal Only On Bar Close (Columns K,M) / (Columns L,N-Z) Input to Yes.</b>

    <p>  All of what is described in this section is something that you need to be aware of when you are looking at the final results of your trading system and comparing them to the current FALSE/TRUE state of the Spreadsheet formulas that you visually see at the present moment.</p>

        <p>The  <b>Number of Rows </b> Input with the Spreadsheet studies, affects the standard  Up and Down arrows displayed on a chart by the  Spreadsheet studies.  You will need to increase this Input value to see arrows going back more bars.  Arrows that were placed on bars further back than the  <b>Number of Rows </b>  Input during real-time updating and chart replays, can disappear, or if they have not been removed because there has not been a full recalculation of the study, they may no longer be valid.</p>

These are always displayed on the Spreadsheet used by the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study, and will only be displayed if the <b>Output Current Quote Data</b> Input is set to <b>Yes</b> for the other <b>Spreadsheet</b> studies.</p>

        <p>When Sierra Chart is connected to a real-time data feed (<b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Connect to Data Feed</b>), the Daily Open, Daily High, Daily Low, Daily Price Change, and Daily Volume  come from this data feed.</p>

        <p>Cells J22 through J25 allow you to set the Limit or Stop order prices for each of the 4 different Spreadsheet Order Actions   (<b>Buy Entry, BuyExit, Sell Entry, Sell Exit</b>). These apply when you have set to use a Limit or Stop order for a particular Order Action in cells J71 through J74. Refer to  <a href="#CellJ71_BuyEntryOrderType">Buy Entry: Order Type [J71]</a>. </p>  

        <p>You are able to set a Limit or Stop price to either the Bid or Ask prices by using these formulas: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=J12</span> (Bid price) or <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=J14</span> (Ask Price). This allows you to buy at the Bid or sell at the Ask respectively.  This is only an example. You can use whatever formula  you require to set whatever price that you want.</p>  

        <p>You can use the Tick Size in cell  <a href="#CellJ21">J21</a> to use  in these Limit or Stop Price cell formulas to specify a certain number of ticks as an actual price value. For example <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">= E3 + 4 * J21</span>.</p>
        
        <p>If this cell is set to 0, and the Order Action is a BUY_ENTRY  or SELL_EXIT than the current  Ask price if available is used. If this cell is set to 0, and the Order Action is a SELL_ENTRY or BUY_EXIT, then the current  Bid price if available is used.</p>

        <p>Setting this cell to <b>TRUE</b> or any non-zero number (such as <b>1</b>) will trigger the canceling of orders. You can  also Input a formula into this cell to cancel all working orders when certain conditions are met.</p>

        <p>The canceling of orders occurs before any of the Entry and Exit signal cells are evaluated.  However, these cancellations in the case of non-simulated trading do take time to occur and they will be pending during the evaluation of the Entry and Exit signal cells.</p>

        <p>When this cell is set to a nonzero or TRUE value, additional cancellations will not occur until it is set back to zero or FALSE  and then back to a nonzero or TRUE value.</p>

This example will return TRUE when the time is 16:15 or greater.  Cell J41 is the latest time in the last bar in the chart.

        <p>When Cell J28 is set to TRUE it disables all trading from the Spreadsheet. When this cell is set to <b>TRUE</b>, all Spreadsheet Buy/Sell entries and exits, flatten Position and cancel order commands are <em>ignored</em>. </p>

This paragraph applies to versions 1463 and higher.</p>

        <p> You can enter a formula in this cell to <em>disable trading</em> when certain conditions are met or even when the latest Date-Time of the last bar in the chart meets some specified time condition. Manually setting this Input to <b>TRUE</b> or any non-zero number will simply <em>disable</em> all auto trading until the cell is set back to <b>FALSE</b>.</p>

        <p>If you want to disable automated trading at a specific time, then you can use a formula like this: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=(J41-INT(J41)) &gt; TIMEVALUE("16:15:00")</span>. This example returns TRUE when the time is 16:15 or greater.  Cell J41 is the latest time in the last bar in the chart.

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SpreadsheetCalcProcessingOfSpreadsheetData">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>This section describes  the calculations of formulas on a Sheet in a Spreadsheet window and the subsequent reading and processing of values and formula results  from a particular Sheet being referenced by one of the Spreadsheet studies. There is a difference between these two operations and this needs to be understood. </p>

    <p> The general method by which a Spreadsheet study interacts with a particular Sheet in a Spreadsheet window (also known as a Sheet Collection), is that first the chart data and study values are outputted to the Sheet.  The chart data is outputted beginning at column A. The study data is outputted beginning at column AA, assuming there are 16 formula columns set.</p>

    <p> The Sheet is calculated, and then the Spreadsheet study gets the results from the formula columns K through Z (last formula column by default if using 16 formula columns) and processes those results and puts them into internal chart arrays of the  Spreadsheet Study for graphing on the chart. During a full recalculation, all rows of the formula columns are put into the internal chart arrays of the  Spreadsheet  Study.  When the last bar in the chart is being updated, or a new bar is added during a chart replay or during real-time updating, only the very topmost rows  (10 rows) are copied to the internal chart data arrays from the formula columns.</p>

    <p>In the case of the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study, if there is a full recalculation of the chart, the Sheet will be updated and calculated, however there will not be processing of any of the  Sheet formula columns during that full recalculation, by the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study. A full recalculation will occur when the chart is opened as part  of its Chartbook opening, studies are modified  through the Chart Studies window, or if the chart has been tagged for a full recalculation by a chart it is referencing. This last case is not a common case.</p>

    <p>After a full recalculation occurs, it is normal for the last bar in the chart to be calculated again.  At this time it is normal for any of the <b>Spreadsheet</b>  studies to process the formula columns for the last bar in the Sheet.</p>

    <p>In the case of the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study, if 100 or more bars are added at once to the chart when the chart is updated, then there will not be processing of the Sheet formula columns. This kind of event will be indicated in the <b class = "menu_item">Trade  &gt;&gt; Trade Service Log</b> when it happens.</p>

    <p>The below sections explain  how the K through Z formula columns that contain formula results are processed based on the <a href="#SignalOnlyonBarClose">Signal Only on Bar Close</a> inputs. There are two of these inputs and this section applies to both of them. For example, if you use the <b>Signal Only on Bar Close (Columns K, M)</b> Input, then this description would apply to columns <b>K</b> and <b>M</b>.</p>

    <p>The time at which formula results are processed by any of the <b> Spreadsheet</b> studies is after all the Sheets within the Spreadsheet have been calculated and all cells are reporting their current values. </p>

    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id="IfSignalOnlyOnBarCloseIsSetToNo">If <b>Signal Only on Bar Close</b> is set to <b> No</b>, then the following occurs:</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#IfSignalOnlyOnBarCloseIsSetToNo">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>If there are no new bars added to the chart during a chart update, then only Sheet row 3 is checked for TRUE/FALSE values that are returned by formulas in the Spreadsheet signal columns (K-Z).</p>

        <p>If there are new bars added to the chart during a chart update, then the first row in the Sheet that is examined for TRUE/FALSE values that are returned by the formulas, is the previous topmost row during the prior update (the data previously at row 3).</p>

        <p>The reason the previous topmost row is examined, is because there could be changes with the price data and studies at that row during the chart update.  In other words, the examination continues where it left off.</p>

        <p>Next, the Spreadsheet study processing function  moves up the rows all the way up to 3, examining for TRUE/FALSE conditions row by row. For example, if there is one new bar added, then first row 4 is examined and then row 3 is examined for TRUE/FALSE conditions.</p>

        <p>One potential issue to be aware of with this processing logic is that if a formula in a particular column is TRUE at row 3 and then a new bar is added and it becomes FALSE at row 4, then the internal state maintained by Sierra Chart for the Spreadsheet column goes to FALSE and can then go back to TRUE if the formula is TRUE at row 3 during that update.</p>

        <p>The potential issue with this is an unexpected signal due to a state change.</p>

        <p>If there are no new bars added to the chart during a chart update, then only Sheet row 4 is checked for TRUE/FALSE values that are returned by formulas in the Spreadsheet signal columns (K-Z).</p>

        <p>If there are new bars added to the chart during a chart update, then the first row in the Sheet that is examined for TRUE/FALSE values that are returned by the formulas, is the previous second topmost row during the prior update (the data previously at row 4).</p>

        <p>The reason the previous second topmost row is examined, is because there could be changes with the price data and studies at that row during the chart update. Although, usually not in this case since the data was previously at row 4. In other words, the examination continues where it left off.</p>

        <p>Next, the Spreadsheet study processing function moves up the rows all the way up to 4, examining for TRUE/FALSE conditions row by row. For example, if there is one new bar added, then first row 5 is examined and then row 4 is examined for TRUE/FALSE conditions.</p>

        <p>One potential issue to be aware of with this processing logic is that if a formula in a particular column is TRUE at row 4 and then a new bar is added and it becomes FALSE at row 5, then the internal state maintained by Sierra Chart for the Spreadsheet column goes to FALSE and can then go back to TRUE if the formula is TRUE at row 4 during that update.</p>

        <p>The potential issue with this is an unexpected signal due to a state change. Although, this kind of scenario is highly unlikely with <b>Signal Only on Bar Close</b>  set to Yes because data other than at the last bar in the chart is not likely to change.</p>

        <p>When the formula results in columns K through Z (last formula column by default) are processed for Trade Order or Alert signals by the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> or <b>Spreadsheet System/Alert</b> studies, column K is evaluated first, then L, then M, and so on through  and including the last formula column (by default column Z). The last formula column is set by the  <b>Number of Formula Columns</b> Input.</p>

        <p> Therefore in the case of the  <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study, the following columns are evaluated in the order in which they are listed left to right: <b>Buy Entry, Buy Exit, Sell Entry,  Sell Exit</b>.</p>

        <p>The order of calculation for the formulas in cells within a Spreadsheet is based upon the dependency they have to each other.  A cell dependent on another cell is always going to be calculated after the cell it is dependent on. </p>

        <p>In the case  where 2 cells refer to each other, this is known as a circular reference. In the version of Sierra Chart with New Spreadsheets, there is no special handling of a circular reference, the result can be unpredictable, and an error may be given. Circular references are not supported as they simply make no  mathematical sense and have an absolute impossibility to resolve accurately. </p>

    <h2 id="AutomatedTradingExample">Multiple Exit Automated Trading Example</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#AutomatedTradingExample">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>This is an example of an automated trading exit which utilizes two targets. This example applies to the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study. A Stop is not used in this example. There are three formulas involved in this strategy and they are used in the following cells:  <b>Buy Exit</b> (L3), <b>Sell Exit</b> (N3), and <a href="#CellJ26_OrderQuantity">Order Quantity (J26)</a>.</p>

    <p>In this example, these formulas set a price target of 3 points and 5 points away from the Position Average Price (<a href="#CellJ9">Cell J9</a>). It is assumed that there is a Position quantity of 5.</p> 

    <p>For the first target, two contracts will be exited. For the second target, three contracts will be exited.</p>

    <p>Order Quantity Formula (<a href="#CellJ26_OrderQuantity">Cell J26</a>): <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=IF( ABS(J8) = 5, 2, IF( ABS(J8) = 3, 3, 0))</span>. This means that  if the absolute value of the current Position Quantity is 5, the   Order Quantity will be 2,  otherwise if the absolute value of the current Position Quantity is 3, the order quantity will be 3, otherwise it will be 0.</p>

    <p>Buy Exit Formula (Cell L3): <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR( AND( $J$8 = 5, ID0.SG4@$3 - $J$9 &gt; 3), AND( $J$8 = 3, ID0.SG4@$3 - $J$9 > 5))</span></p>

    <p>Sell Exit Formula (Cell N3): <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=OR( AND( $J$8 = -5, $J$9 - ID0.SG4@$3 &gt; 3), AND( $J$8 = -3, $J$9-ID0.SG4@$3 &gt; 5))</span></p>

    <p>This is merely a simple example and this will need to be tested  and modified to be certain it will work for you.  For the documentation for the  <b> IF</b> function, refer to  <a href = "index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#IF_Function"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IF Function</a>.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#LimitingTradingToCertainTimeRanges">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>This section uses the <a href = "index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#FRACTIME_Function">FRACTIME</a> function.</p>

    <p>To restrict trading during only a certain time range, you can use the <a href="#CellJ28_DisableAutoTrading">Disable Auto Trading cell</a>.</p>

    <p>Here is an example formula to limit trading during a specific time range: <span class="SpreadsheetFormula">=AND((FRACTIME(J41)) &gt; TIME(9, 30, 0),  FRACTIME(J41) &lt; TIME(16, 15, 0))</span>. J41 contains the <a href="#CellJ41">Last Bar End DateTime</a>.</p>

    <p>Or this formula could be combined into a Buy Entry and Sell Entry formula by using the AND function.</p>
