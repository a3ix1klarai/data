    <h2>Log of Changes and Improvements to Sierra Chart</h2>
    
    <p>This list contains major items of development, items which are notable, and changes and additions which users need to be informed about.</p>
    
    <p>This is not a comprehensive changes and additions log. It only represents <em>less than 25% of the actual development</em>  performed every day. There are <em>not</em> version notes for each version. The main Sierra Chart documentation is updated as needed relating to the changes and additions.</p>

    <p>In addition to the below listed items for each version, there are also various low-level improvements, issues resolved, and small additions that a release has which are not listed.</p>

    <ul class="NewListing">
        <li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2331>2331 Release Date: 2021-11-26</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2331">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul> 
    <li> Added support for third Internet connection for Teton Order Routing service.</li>
    
    <li>  Enhancements to Duplicate Chart  interface.</li>
    
    <li> Added new <a href = "index899f.html?page=doc/GeneralSettings.html#UseSingleClickToEditItemInSettingsWindow ">UseSingleClickToEditItemInSettingsWindow</a>  setting to General Settings.</li>
    
    <li> Resolved issue with  <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#CombineTradesIntoOriginalSummaryTrade">Combine Trades into Original Summary Trade</a>  when used with EUREX data from the Denali Exchange Data Feed where when the exchange did not provide an indication of the end of the block of trades that belong to a summary trade, there could be trades which were filtered out from the chart bars.</li>
    
    </ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2327>2327 Release Date: 2021-11-10</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2327">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul> 
    <li>Resolved issue from a recent release where the Step 2 for Move to Breakeven Stop did not function.</li>

    <li>Implemented solution to issue where when connecting  to the Denali Exchange Data Feed more than once from the same computer, the connection sometimes would be denied due to different devices being detected.</li>

    <li>Corrected issue with real time and historical data for Binance not being requested. This issue arose in a recent release.</li>

    <li>Previously Released:  With the Trade Account Settings  window, when there are uncommitted changes for the <b>Symbol/Products Limits</b> or <b>Symbol Commissions</b> tab, and an Update operation is performed, those uncommitted changes  are no longer removed. They will be maintained and can be committed subsequently.</li>
    
    <li> Import and Export functionality has been added to the Trade Account Settings window for the <b>Symbol/Products Limits</b> or <b>Symbol Commissions</b> tabs.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2323>2323 Release Date: 2021-10-25</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2323">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul> 
    <li> Resolved an issue from a recent release affecting subscribing to market data  and downloading historical data for spread symbols for the Sierra Chart  Order Routing service. </li>
    <li>  Improvements  with switching to backup connection when using the Sierra Chart Direct Order Routing service. </li>
    <li>   Support for market data from the FairX exchange. </li>
    </ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2310>2310 Release Date: 2021-09-08</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2310">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>   
    
        <li> Corrected an issue from recent release where the order of study Inputs for the RSI studies was mistakenly  reordered.  If you have saved your Chartbook since updating to a version where these  study Inputs were reordered, then after updating to version  2310 or higher, it is necessary to access your <a href = "index7674.html?page=doc/Chartbooks.html#BackupChartbook">Backup Chartbooks</a>  to have the original Input settings restored.   Or you can just  <a href = "index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#AddingModifyingStudies">modify</a> the study Inputs manually to what you previously had set.</li>


        <li>Support for the old Rithmic connection has been removed. Only the new service (<b>Rithmic Direct - DTC</b>) can be used  which will be automatically selected  if the old Rithmic connection  was previously selected. Rithmic has limited historical data and for complete historical data, it is necessary to use the  <a href = "index7dac.html?page=doc/Rithmic.php">Denali Exchange  Data Feed</a> when using Rithmic.  Historical data for the old Rithmic connection was always provided by the  <b>Sierra Chart Historical Data Service</b> which is the same historical data as the Denali Exchange Data Feed, other than the most recent 10 minutes of data which came from Rithmic. 
         <br> <br>
        Therefore,   the historical data that Rithmic users have been used to when using Sierra Chart has always been provided  by Sierra Chart other than the most recent 10 minutes. Gradually across all supported Trading services, historical data now either comes completely from the external service or completely from Sierra Chart provided data feeds  for complete consistency and simplification with data access.  This has now been implemented with  Rithmic as well. 
         <br> <br>
        When updating to this version or higher, it is necessary to translate symbols to the new Rithmic symbol format which use a dot as compared to a - for the delimiter between the symbol and the exchange.  To do this, refer to <a href = "indexa20c.html?page=doc/EditMenu.html#TranslateSymbolsToCurrentService">Translate Symbols to Current Service</a>.

        <h3 id=SCVer2308>2308 Release Date: 2021-09-08</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2308">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>   
    
        <li>  Support for direct CME order routing.  The Trading Service is listed as <b>SC CME Futures Order Routing</b> in   <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt;Data/Trade Service Settings</b>. We expect this service to become available for users to use, towards the end of September  or the beginning of October 2021.  This service provides high-quality, very low latency, direct order routing to the CME with advanced risk management.</li>


        <li>Corrected issue with adjusting secondary  anchor point on the Pitchfork drawing tool. </li>

        <li>Corrected an  issue with  Attached Orders Scale Out that occurs under certain circumstances  where an additional Stop order  was having scale out applied when it should not be. </li>

        <li> Corrected an issue,  with ACSIL n_ACSIL::s_LineUntilFutureIntersection  lines that use UseLineValue2  where the  lines were  not always stopping at future intersection bars.  </li>

        <li>Resolved an issue from a recent release  causing  order fills  for the Trading Evaluator service to have an incorrect timestamp.  This would cause them to effectively not be seen in the  Trade Activity Log. </li>

   <li>  Effective with version  2288, custom study functions that use the sc.SmoothedMovingAverage  function need to be recompiled due to changes with the parameters of this function.</li>
   <li> Corrected issue from a recent release where the price display formatting in the Trade Orders List may not be correct in all rows. This was related to an optimization that was done  and an unexpected side effect. </li>

   <li>The median line beginning point of a Pitchfork drawing can now be changed by adjusting the two immediate parallel lines to the median line. This is supported for the standard Pitchfork drawing but not yet properly supported for  Schiff and  Modified  Schiff pitchfork drawings.    Support for these types of  Pitchfork drawings will be implemented as soon as possible.</li>
    
    <li>  We have had a few reports, upon opening a Chartbook, where the symbol of the charts were changed to what appears to be a corrupt symbol.  We have  determined the cause of this, and  resolved it.  It is *not* due to a direct programming error or any corrupt values within Sierra Chart or the Symbol Settings. The reason for this is because there has been a case where  when translating symbols in a Chartbook when the Chartbook is being opened,  an event triggered	apparently on a window creation of a chart,  related to the updating of	symbol settings which caused the  translation database to be cleared causing corrupt
	values to be used previously when a reference was being held to the
	STL container object  containing the database. This caused invalid symbols
	to be set within charts during the translation.  This was a completely unexpected behavior at the operating system level.  A message event on the same thread should never have been occurring, during execution of an unrelated event on the same thread.
     <br> <br>

     Anyway, this problem is now resolved and it is very important that all users update to this release or higher as soon as possible to avoid the potential of this issue. We still need to look at the range of versions affected. It would be approximately versions in the last  3 to 4 months.   In our experience, it is a rare issue but it could potentially happen.
    </li>
    
     <li>Various other development related to risk management,  and managing Trade Account settings  for the trade simulation service and live order routing.  </li>
     <li>  Resolved a problem, where there would be an unnecessary connection to a market by order server, for option symbols for the Denali  Exchange Data Feed.  Options do not support a separate connection for market by order  data and there would be a continuous reconnection to an invalid server port.  Options also do not support this type of data either.</li>

  <li>Support for market by order data (MBO) on separate connection.  This data is now delivered on a separate connection in order to not impact the latency of  standard trade and market depth data.  Market by Order data is provided with the Denali Exchange Data Feed  and the Delayed Exchange Data Feed.</li>
  
  <li>Resolved various small issues, related to market by order data on a separate connection.</li>
 
  <li>Support for accessing Denali  Exchange Data Feed from the NY4 server.   This applies to the upcoming CBOE Futures data, and NASDAQ stock data.  Both of these data feeds provide full market depth. CBOE futures data will support market by order data.</li>

    <li> Corrected a problem with the CQG Trading service where when using the Denali Exchange Data Feed, there was an unnecessary request for historical Minute data  from the Denali Exchange Data Feed,  followed by the standard historical data request.  This would not occur under all conditions. This issue is now resolved.  This problem arose, when Sierra Chart  switched to  using CQG historical data rather than the subsidized historical data system that we developed for CQG.
    <br><br>
     This is considered a critical update. Any user using CQG will need to update.

     <li> Corrected a problem with the CQG trading service, where when getting the option symbols for a particular symbol from CQG, or  using a CQG symbol  as a Trade only symbol, and that particular symbol was not used for obtaining a quote or a chart during the connection, when a chart is later opened for that symbol or it is used on a quote board,  and the market data is requested from CQG at that time, the correct_price_scale  variable had not  been processed in the symbol resolution report. 
       <br> <br>
     Therefore, leading to incorrect  prices when processing market data.  This is an unusual scenario  and the underlying reason for this is a not well-designed API from CQG  and a design that we fundamentally disagree with for various reasons including the fact that it greatly increases code complexity with the mapping of symbols  to server assigned and connection specific IDs  which  CQG uses. For example, even submitting an order requires an integer   identifier rather the actual symbol.  This specific design is not used by any other supported Trading service.  This issue arose when we added support with the CQG Web API to use a Trade Only symbol which originally was unsupported due to this unusual design from CQG.
      <br> <br>
      There are also other verified causes of incorrect data from CQG which are unrelated to this and are a CQG server issue.</li>

     <li> Some changes have been made in ACSIL regarding modification of Chart Drawings  which use the <b>s_UseTool::RetracementLevels[]</b> structure  array member. 
      <br> <br>
     The following structure members:  s_UseTool::Color, s_UseTool::LineWidth, s_UseTool::LineStyle now will only  modify what are regarded as the special levels of these types of  Chart Drawings.  These are levels that you can see in the  <a href = "indexb844.html?page=doc/Tools.html#DrawingToolConfiguration">Chart Drawing Properties/Configuration</a> which cannot be removed.  For example, the main sloping line of the Price Retracement drawing would be considered a special level.

      It is now supported to add additional levels just  by setting the value for those levels within the <b>s_UseTool::RetracementLevels[]</b> array.
     <br> <br>
     To change any of the appearance properties of the visible levels, not the special levels, then this can only be done  through the following structure  array members: s_UseTool::LevelColor[], s_UseTool::LevelStyle[], s_UseTool::LevelWidth[].

     <li>New ACSIL member to access  the same data as the <b>Large Volume Trade Indicator</b> study:  <b>sc.p_VolumeLevelAtPriceForBars</b>.  This is a pointer to this class: c_VolumeLevelAtPriceContainer. This class is derived from c_VAPContainerBase and uses the s_VolumeLevelAtPrice data structure.  Therefore, it functions the same as  <a href = "index49ba.html?page=doc/ACSIL_Members_Variables_And_Arrays.html#scVolumeAtPriceForBars">sc.VolumeAtPriceForBars</a> except that the structure is of type s_VolumeLevelAtPrice.</li>

    <li>Support for Market  by Order of from the CME. This only works with the  <b>Denali  Exchange Data Feed</b> and the   <b>Delayed Exchange Data Feed</b>.  This is enabled through  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt;  Sierra Chart Server Settings &gt;&gt; Subscribe  Market by Order Data when Market Depth Subscribe</b>. 
     <br> <br>
    The position in queue for the orders may not be correct as it is based upon the exchange order ID whereby a lower order ID means  an order will be considered  to be filling earlier than orders with a higher order ID.  This may not actually be correct because as an order is modified,  the CME order ID remains the same. If we have this wrong, additional work is required for us to utilize the timestamp of an order update from the exchange to determine its position in queue.</li>

    <li>Ability to hide Trading Account list Box on Trade Window. Accessible through the Trade Window  <b class="menu_item">Settings</b> sub menu.</li>
    
    <li>Added option on Scale Window for <b>Use in Left Side Scale</b>. The first found study that has this enabled will be used to set the scaling for the Left Side Scale (if it is enabled). This setting is Off by default, therefore if you had a study that was setting the Left Side Scale, you will need to enable this option for that study to continue to have it set that scaling.</li>
    
    <li>Universal support for wide/16-bit/Unicode characters. Now all character sets in the world can be used throughout Sierra Chart universally.  The menus can be customized. Soon there will be   support for customizing the text of control bar buttons into another language and also for the settings names within the new Settings Windows which are replacing the older dialogs in Sierra Chart. This will bring about universal support  for any language within Sierra Chart.  Also it is now supported to use any character set when setting text on Chart Drawings.</li>

This is now resolved.</li>
    
    <li>   Resolved problem with the initial loading of market depth data in a chart, where there was excessive amount of records processing which would cause freezing of Sierra Chart.  If you are using the   <b>Market Depth Historical Graph</b> study,  it is essential  to update to this version or higher. Our analysis of the problem is that this has been a long-standing issue.   If you have experienced delays or freezing when opening a Chartbook, and you are using the  <b>Market Depth Historical Graph</b>, then most likely it is due to this reason.</li>

    <li>New Input on <b>Market Depth Historical Graph</b> named <b>Automatic Combine Increment Adjustment Value</b> which, when set to a value greater than 5, will allow the Market Depth Historical Graph to automatically combine/disjoin increments as the chart scale is changed.</li>
    
     <li> The return type for the following ACSIL functions has been changed from a double type  to SCDateTimeMS. Previously this was not done when the new integer based SCDateTime/SCDateTimeMS  were released since using these types as a return value  would lead to an invalid return value when using other compilers other than Visual C++. We have tested again with the compiler used for the Sierra Chart Remote Build functionality and do not observe any problem with this.  So we have now changed  the return type to SCDateTimeMS. It was necessary to make this change because there is a small degree of floating-point error when using a double type that would lead  to a time value being off by a microsecond   which can cause a problem when that is not expected.   Therefore, any ACSIL  study which uses these functions needs to be recompiled for version 2195 or higher.   If the study is not recompiled, then the functions will do nothing and add an error message to the Sierra Chart Message Log.:<br> <br>

     <li>Updated   <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Trade Settings</b> window to the new high-performance settings window format.</li>
    
    <li>Added to the   <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Trade Settings</b> window    the <b> Trade   Order Alert Trade Accounts Filter</b> which can contain a list of trade accounts to generate trading alerts for.

        <ul>    

     <li>Corrected a problem  from a release about middle of July 2020, where file compression was not automatically being enabled for Intraday data files and market depth data files.  The reason this occurred is that the file handle being used for compression did not have write access to the file.  The compression that Sierra Chart uses is NTFS compression provided by the operating system. If compression was enabled on the Data Files Folder Sierra Chart is using, then you  would have had compression anyway.  We have also implemented asynchronous compression, so when compression is enabled on a large file, the compression occurs in the background.
     <br> <br>
     During the time that the operating system is compressing an Intraday data file or market depth data file, there will be slower performance with reading these files in Sierra Chart. Once the operating system is finished compressing these files, which should just take no more than a few minutes, usually, then the performance will return to normal and actually be improved.   The initial compression is just a one time operation.
     </li>
     
     <li>  Various new features added to the TPO Profile Chart study.  One feature allows up to five independent  sessions/TPO profiles per trading day.  The  TPO Profile Chart study  Inputs for this are:  <b>Number of Custom Intraday Sessions</b>, <b>Custom Intraday Session # Begin Time</b>, <b>Custom Intraday Session 1 End Time</b>.</li>

        <ul>    

     <li>Added flush to physical  storage drive functionality, when writing Chartbooks to avoid this problem some users have reported:  <a href = "index7674.html?page=doc/Chartbooks.html#PotentialOperatingSystemIssueWhenSavingChartbookDuringSystemShutDown">Potential Operating System Issue When Saving Chartbook During System Shut Down</a>. </li>
     
    <li>  Added the  <b>s_SCNewOrder::MoveToBreakEven_2</b>  member to the ACSIL new order structure to set the settings for Step 2 for  Move to Breakeven for Stops. </li>
    
     <li> Added support for higher compression level for real-time data compression.  This is controlled through  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Sierra Chart Server Settings</b>. The setting is "High Compression".
      <br> <br>
     Update regarding the above: We do not recommend using it. It appears to be causing a datastream corruption. Only use Standard Compression. we are looking into the issue.</li>

     
    <li> New TPO profile chart features added. </li>

        <ul>    

     <li> Resolved a problem from a recent release related to real-time data compression, which prevented a connection to the Sierra Chart Exchange Data Feed for equities data.  Compression for this data feed will be supported in the next release.</li>
     
    <li> Resolved a problem with the increment and decrement buttons on the order modification window which would cause the cell editing to become canceled and those buttons would not work.  This is now resolved.</li>    
    <li>  The Teletrader  market data service is ending support for Sierra Chart in February 2021.  Support for it within Sierra Chart has now been removed since there are next to no users of  the Teletrader service.</li>

     <li>  Corrected a problem from a recent release  where the quote lines on Quote Spreadsheets   were not updating. This is now resolved.</li>
     
    <li>New Graphics Options for Cumulative Last Size Chart/Trade DOM Same Price and Side Background/Text, that allows for a new color when an update to the Cumulative Last Size column is at the same price and side.</li>

    <li>New Input for Volume by Price named <b>Use Defined Width for Side-By-Side Profiles on Right</b>. When set to Yes, the profile width for Side-by-Side profiles on the right will not change as bars are moved above/below the visible area.</li>

        <ul>    

     <li>The 32-bit version of Sierra Chart is not included with this release.  Running SierraChart.exe will start the 64-bit version instead.</li>
     
     <li>Several technical improvements to the  <b>High/Low For Time Period - Extended </b> study to better handle certain time configurations and chart  bar time configurations, which previously could cause the study to not draw the lines for the right time period,  or not draw the lines at all,  or not stop the lines at the correct time.</li>
     
     <li> Implemented data feed compression. This has been first released for the  Denali Exchange Data Feed and will be released for other data feeds. This reduces bandwidth usage and reduces latency.</li>
     
     <li>Added new Background and Text coloring options for the Recent Bid/Ask Chart/Trade DOM columns to allow a different color when an update occurs at the same Price and Side.</li>
     <li> Added the sc.AddStudyToChart  ACSIL function.</li>    
     
     <li>Updates to the Market Depth Historical Graph for the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Allow the Highest Quantity for Coloring to be set by either an actual value or as a percentage of the Maximum Depth value.</li>
            <li>Changes to the naming of the <b>Maximum Quantity for Coloring</b> and the <b>Graph Only Quantities Greater Than or Equal To</b> to be <b>Highest Quantity for Coloring</b> and <b>Lowest Quantity for Coloring</b>.

     <li>Corrected an issue when using the  Draw Volume Profile tool with a specified  Study  Collection in the Tool Configuration or default study settings  for the Volume by Price study causing an incorrect  instance identifier to be used which could subsequently cause incorrect behavior or an exception.</li>
     
     <li>  Increased received buffer sizes for network connections.  This change relates to recent performance improvements  at the network socket level.  We have had some reports of users having data stop or lag  and increasing the buffer sizes will generally resolve this  to the  <em>extent it is related</em> to this.   If a data feed issue is not  related to this, then  increased receive buffer sizes will have no effect.</li>

        <ul>    

     <li>Removed support for the CTS order routing service   using the DTC protocol.  This is considered a discontinued service at this time and you should either utilize a different supported trading service like the <a href = "#">Sierra Chart Order Routing Service</a>, or you will need to use the   <b>CTS FIX Trading</b> Service which can be selected through  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Data/Trade Service Settings  &gt;&gt; Service</b>.</li>
     
    <li>Added options for the Numbers Bars to highlight the text based on whether the last trade was at the Bid or the Ask.</li>
    
   <li> Corrected  some small edge case issues involving the new integer based microsecond  Date-Time object within Sierra Chart.</li>
