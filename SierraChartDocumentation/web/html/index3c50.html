And if there is Market Depth data available for the symbol through another chart being opened for the Trade symbol, the problem is that the estimated position is not going to make sense relative to the Market Depth data you are seeing in the chart.   Since that Market Depth data  is for the main symbol of the chart.

                <br> <br>
                If there are multiple orders at the same price level, then you will be given a menu  listing all of the orders when you click on the Quantity Number button to let you select an order to modify. 
                <br> <br>
                A box will display allowing you to enter the new quantity. Enter the quantity or use the <b>+</b> and  <b>-</b> buttons to change the quantity. Press <b>OK</b> to accept.  
                <br> <br>
                You will receive a confirmation to confirm modifying the order quantity.  This can be disabled through the <b>Menu/M</b>  button on the Trade Window.</li>

            <li><b>Canceling an Order</b>: Press the <b>X</b> button on the order line as shown in the image. If there are multiple orders at the same price level, then you will be given a menu listing all of the orders when you click on the <b>X</b> button to let you select an order to cancel. There is also the choice to   <b>Cancel All </b> of the orders at that price level. You will receive a confirmation to confirm cancellation of the order or orders.  This confirmation can be disabled through the <b>Menu/M</b>  button on the Trade Window.</li>

            <li><b>Changing the Price of an Order</b>: Left click and drag the order line as shown in the image to change its price. You are able to click and drag anywhere along the order line to modify the order except for the quantity and "X" buttons. 
             <br> <br>
             By default, when you left click you have to hold that state, and then drag the order and then  release the left click button.  This behavior is changeable.  Refer to <a href = "index4451.html?page=doc/GlobalTradeSettings.html#UseClickReleaseClickAdjust">Working Orders >> Use Click, Release, Click Method to Adjust Orders</a>.

                You will receive a confirmation to change the price of the order.  This can be disabled through the <b>Menu</b> or <b>M</b> buttons on the Trade Window. In the case of Attached Orders that use the <b>All Groups OCO Group</b>, when you modify the price of one of these orders, the others in the same group will be modified as well.

                If after  modifying the price of an order, you notice that the order line jumps back to the original price, then this indicates that the order modification was rejected.

                If an order modification is not completed, then no change to the order has occurred, in which case the order's position in the queue with the trading service does not change. For example, if an order has been moved up using click and drag, but then moved back to the original price before letting up on the left-click button, then the original order is still in place as it was prior to any movement.
            </li>

            <li><b>Precision Price Modification of an Order</b>: If you wish to make a small adjustment to an order in Tick increments and find it difficult to move to the exact price you want when interactively dragging the order line on a chart, then click on the order quantity.  This will give you a box to modify the price.  See image below.  Press OK to complete the order modification.

                <br> <br>
                On a Trading DOM window, the price scale is in 1 Tick increments.  You can then click and drag the order very easily to the exact price that you want.  If you cannot see the order, then refer to the <a href="#ModifyingOrCancelingOrdersthatAreNotVisibleOnTheChartTradeDOM">Modifying or Canceling Orders that are Not Visible on the Chart/Trade DOM</a> section.

            <li>When modifying the price of an existing trailing Stop order, you can choose to have the trailing Stop offset modified to match  the distance  between the price of the order and the current price, or  the distance  between the price of the order and the parent order price the Stop order is a Pending  Child order.

    <p> When there are multiple  parent orders each with their own Attached Orders on the same Chart or Trade DOM, this can get confusing. </p>

    <p>The first solution is to use the Order Association Lines which draws a line connecting each of the child orders to the parent order  and connecting each of the OCO orders together  so you know how they are associated with each other. For instructions, refer to <a href="index4451.html?page=doc/GlobalTradeSettings.html#DrawOrderAssociationLines">Draw Order Association Lines</a>. The Color, Line Style and Width can be set for these lines.</p>

    <p> The next solution is to use separate Charts or Trade DOMs  set to the same Symbol and Trade Account. Each one will have its own set of orders. They will only contain the orders that were directly entered from them. Therefore, eliminating any confusion.</p>

    <p>To do this, follow these instructions:</p>

    <ol >
        <li>Go to the Chart or Trade DOM which you are using for order entry and use the  <a href="indexfd56.html?page=doc/ChartMenu.html#DuplicateChart">Chart &gt;&gt; Duplicate Chart</a> command to create a duplicate of it.</li>

        <li>On the duplicate chart, enable <b Class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Only Orders from Chart</b>. You will know this is enabled when you see a checkmark by it. Do this for other Charts  and Trade DOMs as well where you want this feature.</li>

Daily Profit/Loss is abbreviated <b>DPL</b>.</p>  

        <p>The <b>DPL</b> value indicates the cumulative Profit/Loss of the closed Trades since midnight (default reset time).  </p>

        <p>This <b>DPL</b> value  is considered a Daily Trade Statistic  which resets daily. For complete details, refer to <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#UnderstandingDailyTradeStatisticsResetTime">Understanding Daily Trade Statistics Reset Time</a>.</p>

        <p>When Sierra Chart is in Trade Simulation Mode (<b class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Simulation Mode On</b> is checked), this is the Daily Profit/Loss for simulated trades.  Otherwise, the <b>DPL</b> is for non-simulated trades.</p>

        <p>You are able to hide the <b>DPL</b> display from the chart.  To do this, select <b class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Chart Trade Settings</b> and disable <b>Display Daily Profit/Loss On Chart / Trade  DOM</b>. </p>


        <p>There are various Profit/Loss formats that can be used and these are set by selecting <b class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Trading</b>.

        <p> These columns include Buy and Sell columns, Bid and Ask size/quantity data columns and various other market data columns.</p>

        <p>To customize the columns for the active Chart or Trade DOM, select <b class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Customize Chart/Trade DOM Columns</b>. Since version 1516, the column customization applies to the active Chart or Trade DOM. They are no longer global. They need to be set individually for each Chart and Trade DOM as needed. </p>

        <p  class = "GeneralBackgroundHighlightLight">To add the Bid Size/Quantity and Ask Size/Quantity market depth data into the same columns as the Buy and Sell order columns respectively, use the following two Chart/Trade DOM columns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Bid Size/Buy Column</b></li>
            <li><b>Ask Size/Sell Column</b></li>
        </ul>
        
         <p> Or add the <b>Combined Bid/Ask Size </b> column. <p>

        <p> For a complete description of each of the columns, refer to  <a href="index4451.html?page=doc/GlobalTradeSettings.html#ChartTradeDOMColumnDescriptions"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chart/Trade DOM Column Descriptions</a>.</p>

        <p> For the <b>Bid Size</b> and <b>Ask Size</b> columns, there will not be more than one size/quantity row for the Bid and Ask sides, unless <a href="index8793.html?page=doc/FileMenu.html#OpenMarketDepthWindow" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">market depth</a> data is provided for the symbol from the particular Data or Trading service being used.</p>

        <p>When using the symbols from the <a href="indexc82f.html?page=doc/SCRealTimeFOREX.php">Sierra Chart Real-time and Historical Forex/CFD Data Service</a>, there is only one level of market depth data with quantities of 1. In the case of CME futures market symbols, it is necessary that your market data has activated on it the CME exchanges that provide market depth data, in order to see more than one level of market depth data. The CME does <em>charge extra for market depth data</em>, so your account may not have market depth data on it.</p>

        <p>Follow the instructions below to add studies to a Trade DOM.</p>

        <p>As an alternative to adding studies to a Trade DOM, you can consider using a normal chart which easily supports studies and use the  <a href="#UsingTheChartDOMOrderEntryLadder">Chart DOM</a> feature to trade from the chart.</p>
        
         <p> Sierra Chart support does not provide any help for using studies on a Trade DOM.  The problem is you have no idea what data the study is based upon and therefore how it is functioning without seeing the chart bars.</p>
         
        <ol>
            <li> Select <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Studies</b> from the Trade DOM menu.</li>

            <li> A smaller set of studies is available from the list. Add the studies that you require following the instructions in the <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#AddingModifyingStudies" >Adding/Modifying Chart Studies</a> documentation.</li>


            <li> To add chart studies to the Trade DOM which are not listed and also custom studies, press the <b>Add Custom Study</b>  button on the <b>Chart Studies</b> window. Select the study from the available studies and press the <b>Add</b> button.  Therefore, any study can be added to a Trading DOM.</li>

            <li> It is possible to use the <a href="indexc0f0.html?page=doc/StudyPriceOverlayStudy.php">Study/Price Overlay study</a> to reference studies from other charts and add them to a  Trade DOM. When using the Study/Price Overlay Study, it is necessary to set the <b>Fill Blanks with Last Value </b> input to Yes. And it is necessary to set the <b> Chart Region</b> for the Study/Price Overlay study to 1.</li>  


            <li>Since you have now placed studies on the Trade DOM, it becomes necessary to adjust the Chart Settings for the underlying chart bar data. To do this, modify the settings through the <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings&gt;&gt; Bar Period</b> window. For example, you will need to adjust  the chart bar time period.

    <p>This section documents how to use the Chart DOM and Trade DOM trading interfaces. Whether you are using the Chart DOM  or Trade DOM,  they have the same interface. The Chart DOM / Trade DOM is for entering trade orders (Simulated or Live) in the same way as a traditional trading DOM.  This is also known as an Order Entry Ladder. The image below is a basic overview of what you can do.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/tradingchartdom.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/tradingchartdom.png" width="800"  class="screenshot" loading="lazy" alt=""></a></div>

            When you enable  <b>Trading Chart DOM On</b>, the <b>Chart Trade Mode On</b> and <b>Show Orders and Position</b> options will also be enabled automatically.  When <b>Trading Chart DOM On</b>  is enabled, this well display the   <b>Buy</b> and <b>Sell</b> order entry columns on the right side of the chart which are used for trade order entry.  Refer to the image above. 
            <br> <br>
            In the case of the Trade DOM, <b>Trading Chart DOM On</b> is enabled and stays on.</li>

        <li>To display the Depth of Market sizes/quantities on the Chart DOM / Trade DOM, you will need to add the <b>Bid Size</b> and <b>Ask Size</b> columns if they are not already added. To add these columns, select <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Customize Chart/Trade DOM Columns</b>. 
            <br> <br>
            Add those columns through the <b>Customize Chart/Trade DOM Columns </b> window. It is also supported to display the Depth of Market sizes/quantities within the Chart DOM Buy and Sell columns directly, by adding the <b>Bid Size/Buy Column</b>  and the  <b>Ask Size/Sell Column</b> DOM columns. 
            <br> <br>
            If the Depth of Market sizes/quantities overlap on the Chart DOM, then you will want to consider using the   <a href="index96f7.html?page=doc/TradeMenu.html#DrawDOMGraph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOM Graph</a> as an alternative.</li>

        <li>When using the Chart DOM you may want to change the scale of the chart. For instructions to do this, refer to <a href="#ScalingtheChartDOM">Scaling the Chart DOM</a> section.</li>

        <li> The Chart Trade Mode box at the top left of the chart / Trade DOM displays the quantity for new orders and the price your mouse pointer is pointing to, on the chart and Chart DOM. To change the Order Quantity for a new order, simply click on the Chart Trade Mode box, type in the desired Order Quantity,  or use the + and - buttons, and press <b> OK</b> to accept.  Refer to <a href="#UsingTheChartDOMOrderEntryLadder">instructional image</a>.</li>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ScalingtheChartDOM">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>The most rapid way to automatically scale the Chart DOM is by right clicking along the column of values displayed on the right side of the chart or Trade DOM and select <b>Auto Scale the Chart DOM</b>. This will set the <b>Scale Range</b> to the <b>Constant Range</b> type without auto-centering and set the scale increment to the <b>Tick Size</b>.  </p>

        <p>If you wish to make further adjustments, these are explained in the next paragraphs.</p>

        <p>If the Chart DOM prices or depth of market volumes, are too close together or too far apart, then you have the ability to compress or expand the chart scaling by using the <a href="index981f.html?page=doc/Scaling.html#InteractiveScaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive Scale Range</a> feature. Basically this is accomplished by right clicking over the scale numbers on the right side of the chart and making sure <b>Interactive Scale Range</b> is selected and then dragging along the column of numbers on the right side of the chart to expand or compress the scale.</p>

        <p>If the Chart DOM prices and depth of market volumes are not fully into view as you require, then you have the ability to move the chart up and down by using the <a href="index981f.html?page=doc/Scaling.html#InteractiveScaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive Scale Move</a> feature.</p>

        <p>After adjusting the scaling for the Chart DOM, you may find that the chart bars are not fully into view. In this case you may want to use a <a href="#TradeDOM">Trade DOM</a>. </p>

        <p>To keep the last trade price always centered on the Chart DOM or Trade DOM right-click on the Values Scale column on the right side of the chart, and select <b>Scale Range: Constant Range Auto Center</b>.</p>

        <p>When using the Chart DOM / Order Entry Ladder either on a chart or on a Trade DOM, it is supported to display the order type that will be submitted, either a Limit or Stop type, when left clicking  at a price level in one of the Buy/Sell order entry columns.</p>

        <p>To enable this feature, select <b Class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Chart Trade Settings</b> formatting and enable the <b>Show Limit/Stop in Trade Mode Box </b> option.</p>

        <p>When left clicking rapidly in the Buy or Sell order entry columns on the   <a href = "#UsingTheChartDOMOrderEntryLadder">Chart DOM</a>,  2 left clicks will be interpreted by your operating system as a double-click in most cases resulting only in a single order entry in this case.  </p>

        <p>You are able to change the double-click delay through the operating system control panel but this will affect the entire system. </p>

        <p>If you want to enter two orders rapidly, the proper procedure is that you need  to double the <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#Quantity">Order Quantity</a>  on the Trade Window and then just enter a single order. </p>

        <p> There are two good ways to practice with the  <a href="#UsingTheChartDOMOrderEntryLadder">Chart DOM</a>.</p>

        <p> The first method is to use the  <a href = "index7ada.html?page=doc/SimulatedFuturesTradingService.php">Simulated Trading Service</a> which  uses the   <a href = "indexbbf6.html?page=doc/DelayedExchangeDataFeed.php">Delayed Exchange Data Feed</a> if you are not subscribing to  and entitled to receive Real-time data.</p>

        <p> When using the  <a href="#UsingTheChartDOMOrderEntryLadder">Chart DOM</a> and highlighting the price levels in the Buy and Sell columns on the right side of the chart with your Pointer, you may want to have a horizontal line across the chart at the same time indicating the price level.</p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ImprovingPerformanceOfChartTradeDOM">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>If you are looking for very fast updates on the  Chart DOM or Trade DOM, follow the instructions below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Update to Sierra Chart version 2353 or higher.   Refer to <a href = "indexc97d.html?page=doc/SoftwareDownload.php#FastUpdate">Fast Update</a>.  This is absolutely essential to be running this version or higher. There have been significant performance improvements with the Chart/Trade DOM market data columns.</li>
            
            <li> Use the <b>Denali Exchange Data Feed</b> for the exchanges you require data for.   For full documentation  and instructions, refer to <a href = "index2530.html?page=doc/DenaliExchangeDataFeed.php">Denali Exchange Data Feed</a>. This is very important to be able to control the update speed.  We will not provide any help if you are using another data feed.  This data feed is also very efficiently processed on a background thread using binary encoded data.  This is a huge performance improvement compared to other external data feeds.</li> 
            <li>   Reduce the number of charts or Trading DOMs in total to  <em>no more than 4</em> for the particular Sierra Chart instance  being used.  Other charts and complex charts   need to be moved to <a href = "index9bbd.html?page=doc/NewInstance.php">sub instances</a>. This is absolutely essential.  It is simply not possible to have too many charts within an instance  of Sierra Chart and expect  very fast updates within charts or Trading DOMs. Depending upon what your expectations are, you may only want to have 2 Trading DOMs  or charts  in total  within a single instance.
             <br> <br>
            Additionally  the charts that you have open in an instance using a Chart DOM or Trade DOM must be very simple  and contain no studies or just one or two very basic studies. The reason we say this, is some users are expecting extremely fast updates.  And we have to give you all of the information to achieve this.  We do not know what your expectations are.  If you are looking for  extremely fast updates do  <em>not use any charts</em> within an instance where you have a Trade DOM.
            </li> 
            
             <li>  When using the  <b>Recent Bid/Ask Volume</b> or  <b>Current Traded Bid/Ask/Total Volume</b> <a href="#">market data columns</a> on a Chart/Trade DOM over time the number of price levels that data exists for these increases.           
             
             <br> <br>
             This potentially may be a performance issue if Sierra Chart has been running for many days, or if there has been a lot of market volatility.
             <br> <br>
             
            To reset the size of these containers back to zero, to improve performance, if these containers have become too large, use the commands <a href="index96f7.html?page=doc/TradeMenu.html#ClearRecentBidAskVolume-AllSymbols">Trade &gt;&gt; Clear Recent Bid/Ask Volume - All Symbols</a> and <a href="index96f7.html?page=doc/TradeMenu.html#ClearCurrentTradedBidAskVolume-AllSymbols">Trade &gt;&gt; Clear Current Traded Bid/Ask Volume - All Symbols</a>.</li>
            
            <li>  Adjust the <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#ChartUpdateInterval">Chart Update Interval</a> setting for the chart or Trade DOM to between 40 to 100.</li>
            
            <li>  Adjust the <a href = "index2c7f.html?page=doc/DataSourceSettings.php#RemoteBufferDelaySendTimeInMilliseconds">Remote Buffer Delay Send Time In Milliseconds</a> setting in  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Sierra Chart Server Settings</b> to between 40 to 100.   <a href = "index8793.html?page=doc/FileMenu.html#ProcedureToReconnect">Reconnect</a> the data feed after changing this setting. 
            <br> <br>
            It is very important to be aware that the lower this setting is set to,  the increased chance of packet loss which has the effect of significantly increasing  of the time delay receiving data.   This happens because of packet retransmission.  Using  too low of a value can also cause the data feed to stop due to packet loss.</li> 
            
            <li>  Adjust the <a href = "index2c7f.html?page=doc/DataSourceSettings.php#MaxDepthLevels">Max Depth Levels</a> setting in  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Sierra Chart Server Settings</b>  to the number of market depth levels that you require.  It is important to reduce this to the minimum possible.  <a href = "index8793.html?page=doc/FileMenu.html#ProcedureToReconnect">Reconnect</a> the data feed after changing this setting. This setting does not work with any data feed other than Sierra Chart provided data feeds.</li>

    <a href="../images/filledorderdrawings.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/filledorderdrawings.png" class="WideFloatRight" alt=""></a>

    <p>When a   <a href = "indexf915.html?page=doc/Trading.html#Terminology">Trade Order</a> fills, the order fills can be displayed on the corresponding chart at the  Date-Time of the order fill. </p>


    <p>A single order can have multiple fills. Each fill will be displayed separately.  Also an exit order fill could be split into smaller quantities, in order to match with the quantity of an entry fill.  </p>

    <p>There are various formatting options for the order fills.  </p>

    <p>To display order fills, follow these instructions:</p>
    <ol>

        <li>Enable <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Show Order Fills</b> on the menu. To prevent the displaying of order fills on the chart, disable <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Show Order Fills</b>. This option is specific to each individual chart.   This command applies to the active chart.</li>

        <li>When the <b class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Only Orders from Chart</b> option is checked, then only order fills that are for orders which originated from the chart will be displayed on the chart. So check or uncheck that as you require. This option is specific to each individual chart.   This option applies to the active chart. </li>

        <li>To display non-simulated order fills, for orders that have been submitted to the connected Trading service, make sure there is  <em>no checkmark</em> by  <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Simulation Mode On</b>.</li>

        <li> To display simulated order fills, for orders that have been submitted when in Trade Simulation Mode, there needs to be a checkmark by <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Simulation Mode On</b>.  Therefore, enable this menu option if you want to see order fills which are for orders submitted in Trade Simulation Mode.</li>

        <li> It is necessary to select the correct  Trade Account that the orders are from, on the Trade Window, to see the order fills from that particular account. To do this, open the Trade Window if it is not already open, by selecting  <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Open Trade Window for Chart</b>.
            <br><br>
            On the  Trade Window, in the list of Trade Accounts, select the particular  Trade Account the orders are from to see order fills for those orders.  For instructions  and an image, refer to <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#SelectingTradeAccount" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selecting Trade Account</a>.</li>

        <li> The chart will only display order fills for orders which match  the  <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#Symbol">Symbol</a> of the chart. However, if the <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#TradeAndCurrentQuoteSymbol">Trade and Current Quote Symbol</a> is set for the chart,  then only those order fills matching the   <b>Trade and Current Quote Symbol</b> will be displayed on the chart. 
            <br><br>
            And as explained above,  only the fills that match the Trade Account  of the chart will be displayed. <em>So the fill has to match both the  Symbol and Trade Account of the chart</em>.</li>


        <li>To see the order fills on a chart, there needs to be order fills present for the Symbol and Trade Account  of the chart, in the  <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log &gt;&gt; Trade Activity</b> tab. 
            <br><br>
            To see what order fills are available in the Trade Activity Log, make sure you select <b>Fills</b>  at the top of the Trade Activity Log window. For complete instructions, refer to the <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade Activity Log</a> documentation.</li>


        <li>The setting <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Trading</b>    <b>&gt;&gt;</b> <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#OrderFillsStartDateTime">Order Fills Start Date-Time</a>  will set the chart to load only the order fills from the specified Date-Time. We recommend setting this date-time. However, refer to  <a href="#OrderFillsOnChart_AccurateEntryExitState_FillMatching_PositionQuantities">Accurate Entry/Exit State, Fill Matching and Position Quantities</a>.</li>

        <li>The setting <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt;  Trading</b>  <b>&gt;&gt;</b>  <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#LoadOrderFillsForCurrentDayOnly">Load Order Fills for Current Day Only</a>  will load order fills for the current day only based on the Chart  <a href = "index4ec1.html?page=doc/SessionTimes.php#SessionTimes">Session Times</a>.  Uncheck this if you want to see order fills for more than the current day. 
                <br> <br>
                However, this will also affect the Daily Profit/Loss calculation causing it to potentially be inaccurate and will affect the Position Quantity for simulated trading.
                <br> <br>
                We recommend  <em>disabling</em> this option as it also  overrides the <b>Order Fills Start Date-Time</b> setting.
        </li>

        <li> The above two  described settings <em>must be set correctly</em> because they affect the order fill markers on the chart and whether they are an  <em>Entry or Exit</em>.   It also affects the displayed Position Quantity with order fills. For complete  details, refer to <a href="#OrderFillsOnChart_AccurateEntryExitState_FillMatching_PositionQuantities">Accurate Entry/Exit State, Fill Matching and Position Quantities</a>. </li>


        <li>To change the settings that affect the display of order fills, select <a href="index4451.html?page=doc/GlobalTradeSettings.html#ChartTradeSettings">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Chart Trade Settings</a> on the menu.

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#OrderFillsOnChart_AccurateEntryExitState_FillMatching_PositionQuantities">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>
        
        <p>This section relates to order  fills displayed on the chart. For more information, refer to <a href="#DisplayingOrderFills">Displaying Order Fills on the Chart</a>.</p>

        <p>It is essential to understand that the very first order fill which is loaded into a chart is always considered an <em>opening fill</em> and establishes the reported Position starting from a  Quantity of 0, and the subsequent order fills are considered opening or closing fills based on their Side and the existing Position Quantity. </p> 

        <p>So if the first fill loaded in the chart is a Buy order fill with a quantity of 2, then that fill establishes a  Position  of quantity 2, completely  irrespective  of what the actual Position Quantity was just after that fill executed.</p>

        <p>This is very important because it affects the order fill  markers on the chart and whether they are an  <em>Entry or Exit</em>.   It also affects the displayed Position Quantity with order fills.  </p>

        <p> For information how order fills are matched and how the  Position Quantity is determined, refer to <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#TradeStatsOpenQuantityFieldCalculation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade Statistics Open Quantity Field Calculation</a>. </p>

        <p> There are three settings for controlling the starting Date-Time of  order fills loaded into the chart which is necessary to control the first order fill. The first fill needs  to be the opening fill of the start of a new  Trade Position.  These settings are in  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Trading</b>. They are  <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#OrderFillsStartDateTime" >Order  Fills Start Date-Time</a>, <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#LoadOrderFillsForCurrentDayOnly">Load Order Fills for Current Day Only</a>, and <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#FilterInitialFillsWhichArePartOfExistingPosition">Filter Initial Fills Which Are Part of Existing Position</a>.  </p>

        <p>The Position Quantity reported with the displayed order fill is the   <em>calculated  Position Quantity</em> based upon the first loaded order fill in the chart and does not necessarily represent the actual Position Quantity for the Symbol and Trade Account at that time. For more information, refer to  <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#TradeStatsOpenQuantityFieldCalculation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade Statistics Open Quantity Field Calculation</a>.</p>

        <p>If there is even a single missing order fill since the first fill loaded in the chart, then the open/close state of an order fill will not be interpreted correctly,  the Entry/Exit state of the  order fill will be  incorrect, and the Position Quantity displayed with the fills will be incorrect. To see what order fills are available for a particular Symbol and Trade Account, refer to   <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Viewing Historical Trade Activity</a>.</p>
        
        <p>To retrieve missing order fills, if possible, refer to the <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#AutomaticallyInsertingMissingOrderFills">Automatically Inserting Missing Order Fills</a> instructions. </p>

        <p>If there are still missing order fills which you cannot retrieve, this can be  corrected by adjusting the  <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#OrderFillsStartDateTime">Order Fills Start Date-Time</a> in the  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Trading</b> to a point in time where subsequent to that point, there are no missing fills and at a point in time where the Trade Position was flat for the Symbol and Trade account of the chart. </p> 
        
        <p>You may have to really limit the order fills loaded into the chart by enabling  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Trading &gt;&gt; Load Order Fills for Current Day Only</b>.  In this case, the start of the trading day is according to the Chart  <a href = "index4ec1.html?page=doc/SessionTimes.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Session  Times</a>. </p>

        <p>When <b>Load Order Fills for Current Day Only</b> is enabled,  the processing of the order fills will always consider the trading as if it was flat for the Symbol and Trade Account from the start of the day. </p> 

        <p>The  <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#UseLastInFirstOutFillMatching">Use Last In First Out</a> Chart Setting  affects the connecting lines, if set to be displayed, of order fills displayed on the chart. </p>

        <p>  When using  <a href = "indexad24.html?page=doc/TradeSimulation.php">Trade Simulation Mode</a>, the first fill loaded into a chart will always be the order fill that starts a new  Trade Position.  Any prior order fills  which are available will automatically get filtered out.   Additionally, for the supported Trading services which will give an accurate order fill display and connecting  lines, refer to <a href = "index1a23.html?page=doc/DailyProfitLossValue.html#ConsistentlyAccurateDailyProfitLossValue">Consistently Accurate Daily Profit/Loss Value</a>.</p>

         <p> When comparing the Trades on a chart through the displaying of the order fills, to the   Trades on the  <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#TradesTab">Trades</a> tab Trade Activity Log, you need to make sure the Trade Activity Log is using  the same <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#UnderstandingAndSettingTheStartDateTimeForATradesList">Start Date-Time</a> for the order fills. And also make sure that the <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#UseLastInFirstOutFillMatching">Use Last In First Out Fill Matching</a> and  <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#MenuCommands">Edit &gt;&gt; Use Last In First Out Fill Matching</a> settings match between the  Chart Settings and the Trade Activity Log.</p>

        <p>When performing trading, trading is always for a specific symbol. In the case of  <a href = "index5c14.html?page=doc/ContinuousFuturesContractCharts.html">Continuous Futures Contract</a> charts, there can be more than one symbol loaded into the chart for the historical data in the chart. </p>

        <p>Order fills are only recorded for and only displayed for the <em>current symbol</em> of the chart set in  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Symbol &gt;&gt; Symbol</b>.  And not the historical symbols loaded in the chart.</p>


        <p> If you want to see order fills for a different symbol, then you need to set the chart to that specific symbol. </p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#MisalignedOrderFillMarkers">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p> During simulated trading or non-simulated trading, the timestamp of the order fills which occur in real time are derived from your local computer clock. The necessary time zone adjustments are always made.  If your computer clock is   incorrectly set, then these timestamps will be off.</p>

        <p> During a chart replay, the time stamping of order fills is according to the bar in the chart where they occurred at. There can never be a problem with the time stamping of an order fill during a chart replay.   Unless there is a problem with the chart bar timestamps themselves.</p>

        <p>If you notice that an order fill marker is not aligned to the correct Date-Time in the chart, then this  could be because your computer's clock is not set accurately. In this case, refer to <a href="index3e87.html?page=doc/helpdetails38.html">help topic 38</a>. </p>

        <p> Additionally, any order fills downloaded from the Trading server potentially could have an incorrect timestamp but this is something that we have not known to be a problem. </p>

        <p>For existing order fills  in the Trade Activity Log, it is possible to correct the timestamp of them by editing the <b>DateTime</b> field for them. Locate the order fill by following the instructions for <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Viewing Historical Trade Activity</a>.</p>

        <p>Select that order fill  which has an incorrect timestamp and select  <b Class = "menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Edit Trade Activity Entry</b>.  Correct the Date/Time field. When editing the Date/Time field, the time zone is always according to the Global <a href = "index219e.html?page=doc/TimeZone.html" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Zone</a> setting.

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#OrderFillConnectingLinesDoNotDisplay">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p> This section explains the steps you need to follow to resolve a problem where the order fill connecting lines do not display between the entry and exit order fill markers on a chart or the colors are not as expected according to the color settings. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Make sure the option for Entry/Exit Connecting Lines is enabled. This option is in <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Chart Trade Settings</b>. Enable the option <b>Order Fills &gt;&gt; Display Entry/Exit Connecting Lines</b>.</li>

            <li>If you do not see any order fills displayed, then obviously there are not going to be any connecting lines. Therefore, in that case you first need to follow the instructions to <a href=" #DisplayingOrderFills" >Display Order Fills</a>. </li>

            <li>Make sure the colors of the Entry/Exit Connecting Lines are not the same as the <b>Chart Background</b> color and check the Line Width and Line Style for the connecting lines. 
                <br> <br>
                To change the colors of the connecting lines, refer to the <a href="index2d5c.html?page=doc/ChartTradingCustomizingGraphics.php"  Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customizing Fonts, Colors, Line Styles, and Widths for Chart Trading, Chart DOM, and Trade DOM</a> page. 
                <br> <br>
                The particular graphics objects that need to be set are <b>Colors and Widths &gt;&gt; Chart Trading Order Fills Entry/Exit Connecting Lines Primary</b> and  <b>Colors and Widths &gt;&gt;  Chart Trading Order Fills Entry/Exit Connecting Lines Secondary</b>. 
                <br> <br>
                Refer to the <a href="index2d5c.html?page=doc/ChartTradingCustomizingGraphics.php" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customizing Fonts, Colors, Line Styles, and Widths for Chart Trading, Chart DOM, and Trade DOM</a> documentation for an understanding about these two settings and under what conditions they are used. </li>

            <li>Before a connecting line will be displayed between two order fills, it is necessary that there is both an Entry and an Exit order fill  which have been matched.</li>

            <li> Order fills are matched  First In First Out and according to a Date-Time ascending order.</li>

            <li>Select <b class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Trading</b>. The <b> Order Fills Start Date-Time </b>  needs to be set to the date that you want the orders fills displayed from.  Keep in mind this needs to be at a particular Date-Time where the order fills start a new position.  </li>

            <li> Finally, if you do not understand all of the above information and information linked to and/or you are looking for more help with this, understand that Sierra Chart support does <em>not</em> provide any support for this problem due to the inherent complexities of this which are not within our control since in the case of live trading, there are various aspects of this that are not within Sierra Chart control. </li>

        <p> When an order is submitted from Sierra Chart it can have a short text note or tag applied to it.  This is done through the  <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#TextTag">Text Tag</a> setting of the Trade Window.  </p>

        <p> When the order  fills, this text tag is also  set on the order fill data as well held in the  <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php">Trade Activity Log</a>.  By enabling  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Chart Trade Settings</b> <b> &gt;&gt;   Order Fills  &gt;&gt; Display Note, this text tag will be displayed with the order fill displayed on a chart.</b> </p>

        <p> When enabling   <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Show Order Fills</b>, there is a query made on a background thread for the order fills to display on the chart.  Until this query completes, the order fills will not be displayed on the chart.</p>

        <p>This query normally will be completed in less than a second but it could take longer.   If there is a huge amount of trade activity which has to be processed, perhaps this could take an entire minute or longer.  A long query time is a very unusual case though and in that case you should delete old or excessive Trade Activity. Refer to <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ClearingTradeActivityData">Clearing Trade Activity Data</a>.</p>

        <p>  There can also be multiple outstanding trade activity queries which need to be processed. Only one can be processed at a time and they are placed in a queue.  So  if there are several outstanding queries that still have to be done,  then doing something like enabling the display of order fills on the chart, will not result in the immediate display  of the fills. The queries ahead of the query needed for those fills  needs to complete and then the query for those fills needs to complete. You can see the status of the completed queries in the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Service Log</b>.</p>

       <p>If you still need further  help with the display of order fills,  then  follow through the below instructions.</p>
       
       <ol>
            <li>See if the order fills exist in the  <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Trade Activity Log</a>.  If they do not exist there, then you will not see them on the chart.</li>
            
            <li> Look at the Symbol for the fill in the Trade Activity Log. For the fill to be displayed on the chart, the symbol of the fill must match exactly the <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#Symbol">Symbol</a> of the chart.  Or   it must match the <b>Trade and Current Quote Symbol</b> for the chart if using that symbol in the chart.</li>

            <li>Look at the Trade Account for the fill in the Trade Activity Log. For the fill to be displayed on the chart, the Trade Account of the fill must match exactly the <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#SelectingTradeAccount">Trade Account</a> of the chart. </li>
