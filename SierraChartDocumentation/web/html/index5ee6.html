    <p>The <b>Numbers Bars</b> feature in Sierra Chart is a study that provides a very detailed view of the volume and trading activity within each individual bar in the chart. The regular price bars are replaced with up to 3 columns of numbers. There is a separate number or pair of numbers for each price level for each bar/column in the chart detailing the volume activity at that price level.</p>

    <p>The numbers within a Numbers Bar can represent the difference between the Ask Volume and Bid Volume at each price level, the total Volume or number of Trades at each price level, the Ask Volume and Bid Volume at each price level, and other values. These bars reveal very detailed trading activity within a bar.</p>

    <p>The <b>Numbers Bars</b> study can be configured to display multiple columns of data for each price bar. Each column can be configured to display different data. For example, the difference or delta between Ask Volume and Bid Volume, and another column can be configured to display the Ask Volume and Bid Volume individually. </p>

    <p>The Numbers Bar study is highly configurable and there are numerous coloring options.  </p>

    <p>The Numbers Bars study only functions properly on  <em>Intraday</em> charts.  It <em>cannot be used on Historical Daily charts</em>.</p>

    <p>The data records in the Intraday chart data file for the symbol need to be <b>1 Tick</b> when using Numbers Bars. Otherwise, the displayed Numbers Bars data will be less accurate.</p>
    
    <p>The Numbers Bars study  <em>does *not* require</em> what is known as  <a href = "index8793.html?page=doc/FileMenu.html#OpenMarketDepthWindow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Market Depth data</a>. </p>
    
    <p>  To get started using the <b>Numbers Bars </b> study, refer to <a href="#Instructions">Step-By-Step Instructions</a>. </p>
    
    <p> Numbers bars is also known as   "Footprint" in other charting programs. </p>

    <h2 id="Definitions">Definitions</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#Definitions">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p> This section gives definitions for various terms used on this page. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Numbers Bar</b>: A single column in the chart indicating various calculations at each price level.</li>

        <li><b>Bid</b>: When the market is open for a symbol that can be traded, it will provide a Bid price.  This is the current highest price that someone  in the marketplace is willing to pay to complete a buy transaction for the symbol.</li>

        <li><b>Ask</b>: When the market is open for a symbol that can be traded, it will provide an Ask price.  This is the  current lowest price that someone  in the marketplace is willing to sell at to complete a sell transaction for the symbol.</li>

        <li><b>Trade</b>:  An agreement between a buyer and seller  to take each side of a futures contract or to exchange stock shares. This also applies to other types of tradables. A single trade has a volume indicating the quantity of that trade. In the documentation, the term  <b> Trades </b> is used to indicate the number of trades at a particular Numbers Bar price level or for a period of time. A single trade can have a Quantity or Volume  which is greater than 1.    Therefore, there is a difference between the number of trades at a price level and the quantity or volume of those trades at a price level.</li>

        <li> <b> Tick </b>: Tick has the same definition as <b>Trade</b>.</li>

        <li id="BidTrade"><b>Bid Trade</b> [<a href="#BidTrade">Link</a>]: This is a Trade which is considered to have occurred at the Bid price. A Trade is considered to occur at the Bid price for one of the following reasons. Once one of these is true, there is no further evaluation of whether the Trade occurred at the Bid. 
            <ol>
                <li>The exchange or data feed has indicated the Trade has occurred at the  Bid. If this is supported, this is the most accurate determination. In the case of the CME Group data from the <a href="index2530.html?page=doc/DenaliExchangeDataFeed.php">Denali Exchange Data Feed</a>, this is the method used. So there is 100% accuracy with this. This method is not used with CQG.</li>
                <li>The price of the Trade is at the Bid price or lower.</li>
                <li>The trade occurred between the Bid and the Ask and the Trade direction is a downtick and the Bid direction is a downtick.</li>
                <li>The Trade occurred between the Bid and the Ask and it is closer to the Bid.</li>
                <li>There has been no change in the last Trade price,  and the last Trade was considered a Bid trade. </li>
                <li>The final determination is if the Trade direction is a downtick.</li>
                <li>The determination of whether a trade is at the  Bid price, is not in any way affected by time stamping. The method of the determination is as explained above.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li id="AskTrade"><b>Ask Trade</b> [<a href="#AskTrade">Link</a>]: This is a Trade  which is considered to have occurred at the Ask price. A Trade is considered to occur at the Ask price for one of the following reasons. Once one of these is true, there is no further evaluation of whether the Trade occurred at the Ask.
            <ol>
                <li>The exchange or data feed has indicated the Trade has occurred at the Ask. If this is supported, this is the most accurate determination. In the case of the CME Group data from the <a href = "index2530.html?page=doc/DenaliExchangeDataFeed.php">Denali Exchange Data Feed</a>, this is the method used. So there is 100% accuracy with this. This method is not used with CQG.</li>
                <li>The price of the Trade is at the Ask price or higher.</li>
                <li>The trade occurred between the Bid and the Ask and the Trade direction is an uptick and the Ask direction is an uptick.</li>
                <li>The Trade occurred between the Bid and the Ask and it is closer to the Ask.</li>
                <li>There has been no change in the last Trade price,  and the last Trade was considered a Ask trade.</li>
                <li>The final determination is if the Trade direction is an uptick.</li>
                <li>The determination of whether a trade is at the Ask price, is not in any way affected by time stamping. The method of the determination is as explained above.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        
        <li> <b>Alternative Bid Trade / Ask Trade</b>: In the case of HKFE, cash index symbols, the following method is how a trade is determined to be at the Bid or Ask price. In the case of exchange traded futures, although a trade must always occur at the Bid or Ask price,  based upon the transmission  of the Bid/Ask data from the exchange, often there is no synchronization between this Bid/Ask data and trades. 
        <br><br>
        This is why this special algorithm is used. If the last trade price is the exact same price as previously, then if this price is equal to the current known Bid price, then it is considered a  Bid Trade. If this price is equal to the current known Ask price, then it is considered an Ask Trade. Else if the last trade  is an uptick or was previously an uptick, then the trade is considered to be an Ask Trade. If the last trade  is a downtick or was previously a downtick, then the trade is considered to be a Bid Trade. 
        <br> <br>
        This section does <em>not</em> apply to IQ Feed data.</li>

        <li ID = "BidVolume"><b>Bid Volume / Bid Trade Volume</b>:  This is the sum of all <em>traded volume</em>, not the number of trades,  rather the number of contracts or shares traded, for a Numbers Bar price level or for period of time, that were <em>Bid Trades</em>  (see description above).</li>

        <li ID = "AskVolume"><b>Ask Volume / Ask Trade Volume</b>:   This is the sum of all <em>traded volume</em>, not the number of trades, rather the number of contracts or shares traded, for a Numbers Bar price level or for period of time, that were <em>Ask Trades</em>  (see description above).</li>

        <li><b>Delta</b>:  Sierra Chart does not normally use this term,  since it is to generalized. Typically this means the difference between Ask Volume and Bid Volume at a particular Numbers Bar price level or for a period of time.</li>

        <li> <b>Volume</b>: The total quantity of futures contracts or  stock shares traded at a particular Numbers Bar price level, or for a period of time. The  Daily Volume for a symbol is the exchange reported Trade volume for the symbol for the trading day.</li>

        <li><b>Dominant Side</b>: When comparing the Bid Volume and Ask Volume at a price level, the side with the larger value is considered the <em>dominant</em> side.</li>

        <li><b>Diagonal Dominant Side</b>:  <b>Diagonal Dominant Side</b> is similar to <b>Dominant Side</b>. The difference is the Bid Volume at one price level is compared diagonally to the Ask Volume at the next higher price level.  And the Ask Volume is compared to the Bid Volume at the next lower price level.
            <br>
            <br>
            The side with the larger value is the <em>dominant</em> side. Within a single price level, both the Bid Volume and Ask Volume could be dominant due to the diagonal comparisons of two different price levels. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Within a bar, the highest Bid Volume and lowest  Ask Volume are never dominant because there is nothing to compare against higher or lower respectively.
        </li>

        <li><b>Tick Size </b>: Every symbol that can be traded has a Tick Size. The  Tick Size for a symbol is the minimum value that the price for that symbol can change by.  For example, the  S&amp;P ES futures has a Tick Size of .25.</li>

        <li> <b>Market Depth Data</b>: Market Depth data is data provided by an exchange that contains the quantities of Buy and Sell limit orders currently in the market at price levels nearby the current market price.  Market Depth data is usually anywhere from 5 to 20 levels deep. The <b>Numbers Bars</b> study has <em>no dependency</em> on Market Depth data.  Numbers Bars only requires the best Bid and Ask price. Any study in Sierra Chart that has a dependency on Bid Volume and Ask Volume, has no dependency on Market Depth data. They only require the best Bid and Ask price. Therefore, <em>Market Depth data is not required</em> for Numbers Bars or any study dependent on Bid Volume or Ask Volume.</li>

        <li>The Numbers Bars study supports the ability to configure up to 3 Numbers Bars  columns per underlying chart bar.  For example, if the chart bars are set to 10 minutes per bar, it is possible to define 3 Numbers Bars columns showing data for each 10 minute bar. You will notice in the list of Inputs for Numbers Bars study, 3 sets of Inputs, one for each column. These are   numbered 1 through 3.</li>

        <li>Configure the <b>Column # Numbers Bars Text</b> for each of the 3 Numbers Bars columns you want to use. Numbers Bars can contain 1-3 columns of information. For each of the three columns, select one of the choices. For descriptions of each text type refer to <a href="#TextTypes">Numbers Bars Text Types</a>. If you only want to display a single column, then set <b>Column 1 Numbers Bars Text</b> to the Text type that you require and the other columns need to be set to <b> No Text</b>. </li>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ScalingANumbersBarsChart">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>Due to the nature of <b>Numbers Bars</b> charts you probably will have to change the horizontal and vertical scaling to avoid the numbers in the Numbers Bars from overlapping (refer to image below), or to get the visual appearance that you require. Follow these instructions below.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/numbersbarsscalingproblem.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/numbersbarsscalingproblem.png" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" alt="" width="540"></a></div>

    <ol>
        <li>Select   <b class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Scale</b>.  Make sure the <b>Scale Range Type </b> is set to <b>Automatic</b>. This step is not necessary unless you have previously changed the Scale.</li>

        <li>Confirm that the <b>Scale Range Type</b> for the <b>Numbers Bars</b> study is set to <b>Automatic</b>.  To do this, refer to <a href="index981f.html?page=doc/Scaling.html#ScaleWindowStudy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opening the Scale Window For a Study</a> documentation. This step is not necessary unless you have previously changed the Scale for this study.</li>

        <li>Right-click on the Values Scale of numbers on the right side of the chart and select <b>Reset</b>.</li>

        <li>Increase the chart bar/column spacing (horizontal scaling) by pressing the <a href="index6736.html?page=doc/ControlBar.php#CustomizeControlBar" >Control Bar button</a> that increases the spacing between the bars in the chart until you get a clear view of the numbers. 
            <br>
            <br>
            These are all of the available Control Bar buttons that change bar spacing: <img src="../images/barspacingcontrolbarbuttons.png" alt="">. You can also press the <b> Up Arrow </b> key on your keyboard. For complete instructions, refer to the <a href="index69b6.html?page=doc/WorkingWithCharts.html#ChangingBarSpacing">Changing Spacing</a> documentation on the <b>Working With Charts</b> page.
            <br>
            <br>
            Alternatively, reduce the bar spacing in the chart if the Numbers Bars columns are to far apart which will cause the Numbers Bars columns to be too wide.</li>

        <li>Right-click on the Values Scale on the right of the chart and select <b>Interactive Scale Range</b>. If necessary click and drag down on the Values Scale to expand the chart so that the numbers within the bars are easier to view. When you do this, it will cause the Numbers Bars to be expanded beyond the top and bottom of the chart. 
            <br>
            <br>
            What you can then do in this case is move the chart up and down to see all of the bars. To do this, right click on the Values Scale on the right and select <b>Interactive Scale Move</b>.  You can then click and drag on the Values Scale to move the chart up and down. For additional information about these types of scale changes, refer to the <a href="index981f.html?page=doc/Scaling.html#Scaling" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive Scaling</a> documentation.</li>

        <li>Once you get a reasonable view of the Numbers Bars, the next step is to choose the most appropriate font for the chart. Refer to <a href="#Font">Font Size and Style for Numbers Bars</a>.</li>

        <li>You may want to save the Chartbook by selecting <b Class = "menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Save</b>.

    <p> In this image below, we see Numbers Bars that have overlapping price levels because the  range of prices displayed contains a large number of price levels based upon the chart Tick Size.  </p>

    <p>There is insufficient space to clearly display each price level without overlapping. One effect of overlapping price levels is sometimes based upon the density of those levels, that nothing appears at all for some price levels.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/numbersbarscharttoosmallticksize.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/numbersbarscharttoosmallticksize.png" alt="" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" width="700" ></a></div>

    <p>In the case of a severe overlap like we see above, the solution to this is to increase the <b>Tick Size</b> in <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Symbol</b>. For example, it can be increased by 4 to 10 times or higher. Even 100 times may be necessary.  In this particular case, we have increased it by 10 times. See the result below.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/numbersbarschartincreasedticksize.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/numbersbarschartincreasedticksize.png" alt="" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" width="700" ></a></div>

    <p>Another solution is to right-click on the Values Scale on  the right side of the chart and select <b>Interactive Scale Range</b>. Left click and drag down on the Values Scale to expand the chart so that the numbers within the bars are easier to view. When you do this, it will cause the Numbers Bars to be expanded beyond the top and bottom of the chart. 

    <p>What you can then do in this case is move the chart up and down  to see the top and bottom of the chart bars. To do this, right click on the Values Scale on the right of the chart and select <b>Interactive Scale Move</b>.  Left click and drag on the Values Scale to move the chart up and down. For additional information , refer to the <a href="index981f.html?page=doc/Scaling.html#Scaling" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive Scaling</a> documentation.</p>

    <p>This section describes the <b>Column # Numbers Bars Text</b> study Input. This Input setting determines the specific text which is displayed at each price level within a Numbers Bar.</p>

    <p> For instructions to modify the <b>Column # Numbers Bars Text</b> Input, refer to the <a href="#Instructions">Step-By-Step Instructions</a>.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>No Text</b>: When <b>No Text</b> is selected, then there is no Numbers Bar column displayed.</li>

        <li><b>Ask Vol Bid Vol Difference</b> (AskVolume BidVolume Difference): This Numbers Bars  Text type displays the difference between AskVolume and BidVolume for each price within the Numbers Bar.</li>

        <li><b>Volume</b>: This Numbers Bars Text type displays the Total Volume for each price within the Numbers Bar.</li>

        <li><b>Trades</b>: This Numbers Bars Text type displays the Number of Trades for each price within the  Numbers Bar.</li>

        <li><b>Bid Vol x Ask Vol</b> (Bid Volume by Ask Volume): This Numbers Bars Text type displays the Bid Volume and Ask Volume separated by an <b>x</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>space</b>, or <b>two spaces</b> character(s), for each price within the Numbers Bar.</li>

        <li><b>Dominant Side Volume Percent</b>: This Numbers Bars Text type displays a percentage and it is calculated as follows: 
            <br> <br>
            When Ask Volume is greater than the Bid Volume at a price level within the Numbers Bar, then this will be a positive percentage. This percentage represents what the Ask Volume is percentagewise of the sum of the Ask Volume and Bid Volume for the price level within the Numbers Bar.  
            <br> <br>
            When Bid Volume is greater than the Ask Volume at a price level within the Numbers Bar, then this will be a negative percentage. This percentage represents what the Bid Volume is percentagewise of the sum of the Ask Volume and Bid Volume for the price level within the Numbers Bar.</li>

        <li><b>Price</b>: This Numbers Bars Text displays the actual price for each price within the Numbers Bar.</li>

        <li><b>Ask Vol Bid Vol Difference Diagonal</b> (Ask Volume Bid Volume Difference Diagonal): This Numbers Bars Text type displays 2 values at each price level. 
            <br><br>
            Left Value: <em>Ask Volume at Next Price level -  Bid Volume at Price level</em>. 
            <br><br>
            Right Value: <em>Ask Volume at Price level -  Bid Volume at Previous Price level</em>.
            <br><br>
            In the case where there is a comparison to a Bid or Ask level which does not exist above or below the Numbers Bar, then the resulting value is 0.
            <br> <br>
            It may be useful to  display the <b>Bid Vol x Ask Vol</b> Text Type in a second Numbers Bars column by setting the <b>Column 2 Numbers Bars Text </b> Input to this Text Type.

    <p>For instructions to modify the <b>Column # Background Type</b> Input, refer to the <a href="#Instructions">Step-By-Step Instructions</a>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Full Background</b>: This background type fills the entire background of a price level within a Numbers Bar.</li>

        <li><b>Background on Dominant Side</b> (Supports Separate Bid and Ask Coloring): The functioning of this background type is affected by the <a href="#BackgroundColoringMethods">Numbers Bars Background Coloring Methods</a>. This background type fills 50% of the background of a price level within a Numbers Bar, either the Bid Side, Ask Side or both, depending on which side is the dominant side.
            <br> <br>		
            This setting is only meaningful if the <a href="#BackgroundColoringMethods">Column # Background Coloring Method</a> is set to one of the <b>Dominant Side</b> or <b>Diagonal Dominant Side</b>  Coloring Methods.
        </li>

        <li><b>Background on Dominant Side Outline</b>: (Supports Separate Bid and Ask Coloring): The functioning of this background type is affected by the <a href="#BackgroundColoringMethods">Numbers Bars Background Coloring Methods</a>. This background type outlines 50% of a price level within a Numbers Bar, either the Bid Side, Ask Side or both, depending on which side is the dominant side.
            <br><br>
            This setting is only meaningful if the <a href="#BackgroundColoringMethods">Column # Background Coloring Method</a> is set to one of the <b>Dominant Side</b> or <b>Diagonal Dominant Side</b> Coloring Methods.
        </li>

        <li><b>Volume Profile</b>: This background type fills the background for a price level based upon the volume at the price level compared to the maximum volume among all of the price levels within the Numbers Bar.</li>

        <li><b>Volume Profile Outline</b>: This is identical to <b> Volume Profile </b>, except that only an outline is drawn instead of filling the price level.</li>

        <li><b>Right Aligned Volume Profile</b>: This is identical to <b> Volume Profile </b>, except that the Volume Profile fill is right aligned.</li>

        <li><b>Right Aligned Volume Profile Outline</b>:  This is identical to <b>Volume Profile</b>, except that only an outline is drawn instead of filling the price level and this outline is right outlined </li>

        <li><b>Ask Bid Difference Profile</b>: This background type will calculate the difference between Ask Volume and Bid Volume and color the width of the background of the price levels within the Numbers Bar based upon this difference, relative to the maximum difference. This will give a Volume Profile appearance. 
            <br>
            <br>When highlighting the Point of Control, the price level with the greatest volume may not necessarily be the largest vertical bar based upon this background type.</li>

        <li><b> Ask Bid Difference Profile Outline</b>: This is identical to the <b>Ask Bid Difference Profile</b>, except that only the outline of the volume difference profile is drawn, instead of filling the price level.</li>

        <li><b>Right Aligned Ask Bid Difference Profile</b>: This is identical to <b>Aask Bid Difference Profile</b>, except that the volume difference profile is right aligned.</li>

        <li><b>Right Aligned Ask Bid Difference Profile Outline</b>: This is identical to <b>Ask Bid Difference Profile</b>, except that only the outline of the volume difference profile is drawn, instead of filling the price level and the volume difference is right aligned.</li>

        <li><b>Ask/Bid Volume Split Profile</b> (Supports Separate Bid and Ask Coloring): This background type draws separate Volume Profiles for Bid volume and Ask volume.  The Bid volume is on the left side and the Ask volume is on the right side.  The base of the Volume Profiles is along the center of the Numbers Bar.
            <br> <br>
            Both the Ask and Bid Volume  profiles are built independently. The profile widths are built by looking at the percentage of the Bid Volume/Ask Volume versus the maximum Bid Volume/Ask Volume depending on whether the profile is for Bid Volume or Ask Volume.</li>

        <li><b>Ask/Bid Volume Split Profile Outline</b> (Supports Separate Bid and Ask Coloring):  This is identical to the <b>Ask/Bid Volume Split Profile</b> except only the outline of the Volume Profiles are drawn, instead of filling the price level.</li>

        <li><b>Volume Profile Across All Columns</b>: This background type is identical to the <b>Volume Profile</b> background type except that the bars extend across all the Numbers Bars columns if you are using more than one column per price bar.</li>

        <li><b>Volume Profile Outline Across All Columns</b>: This is identical to the <b>Volume Profile Across All Columns</b>, except that only an outline is drawn for the Volume Profiles, instead of filling the price level.</li>

        <li><b>Ask/Bid Volume Split Profile Across Bid &amp; Ask</b> (Supports Separate Bid and Ask Coloring):  This background type is similar to <b>Ask/Bid Volume Split Profile</b>, however it uses the maximum value across price levels for both the Bid and Ask sides to determine the bar widths. </li>

        <li><b>Ask/Bid Volume Split Profile Across Bid &amp; Ask Outline</b> (Supports Separate Bid and Ask Coloring): Same as <b>Ask/Bid Volume Split Profile Across Bid &amp; Ask</b>, except that only an outline is drawn for the Volume Profiles, instead of filling in the price level. </li>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#TextColoringMethods">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>This section describes the <b>Column # Text Coloring Method</b> study Input. The Text Coloring Method controls the  coloring of the text at each price level within the Numbers Bar.</p>

    <p>The coloring of the Numbers Bars Text is dependent on the <b>Use Separate Colors for Text Coloring Method</b> Input setting. When this is set to <b>Yes</b>, the Numbers Bars Text coloring will use the <b>Range # Up Color for Text</b> or <b>Range # Down Color for Text</b> as appropriate. This allows the text to be seen on top of any background coloring that may be used for the Numbers Bar.

    <p>For instructions to modify the <b>Column # Text Coloring Method</b> Input, refer to the <a href="#Instructions">Step-By-Step Instructions</a>.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>All of the other coloring options continue to work as they did previously and changing this Input will not change how they are calculated or displayed.</p>

        <p>This Input has the following options:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Bar Data</b>: The maximum and minimum values that are used as the denominator in the percentage calculations are determined from the individual bar data.</li>

            <li><b>Daily Data</b>: the maximum and minimum values that are used as the denominator in the percentage calculations are determined from the maximum and minimum values determined over the course of the trading day as defined by the <a href="index4ec1.html?page=doc/SessionTimes.php">Session Times</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example, if the <b>Background Coloring</b> is set to <b>Based on Volume Percentage</b> and the largest volume for the day was 1500 and a specific bar only has a largest volume of 500, then if this Input is set to <b>Bar Data</b>, then that bar will perform the calculations for Volume Percentages using a denominator of <b>500</b> which will establish a 100% value within the bar. But if this Input is set to <b>Daily Data</b>, then that bar will only have a maximum percentage of 33.33% (500/1500). Elsewhere, the bar that contains that volume of 1500 will have the 100% value for the day.</p>

        <p> This section applies to each of the 3 <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b>   Inputs.</p>

        <p>The  <b>Column #  Percent Compare Thresholds</b> is a text string Input with 3 comma separated values.  The default values are <b>.25</b>, <b>.50</b>, and <b>.75</b>.  The leftmost value is considered the first comparison threshold and the rightmost value is considered the third comparison threshold.</p>

        <p>The 3 comparison threshold values  represent <em>percentages</em>. <em>.01</em> equals 1%. So 1.0 is 100 percent.</p>

        <p>Each of the threshold values must be separated by a comma character. </p>

        <p>It is required that these threshold values are in ascending order from left to right.  If they are not, then   they will not match correctly with the color settings. </p>

        <p>These percent compare thresholds are used to determine which of four comparison ranges a Numbers Bar value falls within. These comparison ranges correspond to the 4 Up Color and 4 Down Color settings for each Numbers Bars column.  </p>

        <p>This Input setting only applies when the <b>Column # Numbers Bars Text</b> Input is set to <b>Bid Volume x Ask Volume</b>. Only Bid Volume numbers or Ask Volume numbers that exceed this number will be displayed.  The default value is 0 which means all volume values are displayed.</p>

        <p>This value sets the minimum value required for Bid/Ask Volume comparisons. If the Bid and Ask Volumes that are being compared are both less than the threshold, then the compare is not performed and the resulting background/text coloring is not done for those cells. This allows small values to not be colored even though they meet the compare thresholds (i.e. B|A -> 3|1 -> 300%, but is generally not relevant). The default value is 0 which means all Bid/Ask Volume values are used in comparisons.</p>

        <p>When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b>, then diagonal comparisons against values of 0 are performed by treating the 0 as a value of 1.</p>

        <p>Additionally, this setting also allows the Bid price at the highest price level in a Numbers Bar to be compared to 0 when a diagonal comparison/calculation is being done. And the Ask price at the lowest level in a Numbers Bar will be compared to 0 when a diagonal comparison/calculation is being done. Here again, these calculations are performed by assuming a value of 1 where there is no value.</p>

        <p>This section applies to each of the 3 <b>Column #  Actual Volume Compare Thresholds</b> Inputs.</p>

        <p>The <b>Column #  Actual Volume Compare Thresholds</b> is a text string Input with 3 comma separated values.  The default values are <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, and <b>300</b>. The leftmost value is considered the first comparison threshold and the rightmost value is considered the third comparison threshold.</p>

        <p>The 3 comparison threshold values  represent <em>actual</em> volume or number of trades. They are not percentages.</p>

        <p>Each of the threshold values must be separated by a comma character. </p>

        <p>It is required that these threshold values are in ascending order from left to right.  If they are not, then   they will not match correctly with the color settings. </p>

        <p>These actual volume compare thresholds are used to determine which of four comparison ranges a Numbers Bar value falls within. These comparison ranges correspond to the 4 Up Color and 4 Down Color settings for each Numbers Bars column. </p>

        <p>This Input controls whether the values at the High Price and the Low Price of the bar are ignored for the <b>Highlight Minimum Value In</b> Input. When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b>, the values at the High Price and the Low Price are ignored, otherwise the values at the High Price and the Low Price are included in the decision of where the minimum highlight is placed.</p>

        <p>This option works with all settings of the <b>Highlight Minimum/Maximum Values Based On</b>, including the setting for <b>Price</b>. Therefore, if the <b>Highlight Minimum/Maximum Values Based On</b> is set to <b>Price</b> and the <b>Ignore High and Low Prices for Highlight Minimum Value In</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>, then the values one level up from the lowest price will be highlighted instead of the lowest price.</p>

        <p>This Input modifies the number of digits that are displayed for the Volume data in the Numbers Bars. The default value of <b>1</b> displays the data with no modifications.</p>

        <p>Selecting a value other than 1 will shift the digits to the right, thereby displaying fewer total digits.</p>

        <p>For example, a Volume of <b>12345</b> with a Volume Display Multiplier of <b>1</b>  will display as <b>12345</b>. It will display <b>123</b> with a Volume Display Multiplier of <b>0.01</b>.

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ColorSettingsAndLogicForNumbersBars">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>This section describes the coloring logic for the <b>Column # Background Coloring Method</b> and the <b>Column # Text Coloring Method</b> Input settings.</p>

    <p>Each of the 3 Numbers Bars columns has 8 definable Color Inputs (4 Up and 4 Down) that correspond to the <a href="#Input_ColumnNumberCompareThresholds">Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</a> or the <a href="#Input_ColumnNumberActualVolumeCompareThresholds">Column # Actual Volume Compare Thresholds</a> Input values depending upon whether the comparison is done using a percentage or actual volume value.</p>

    <p>There is an additional <b>Default Background Color</b> input that is used when a Diagonal Dominant <b>Column # Background Coloring Method</b> is selected and neither the Bid Side or the Ask Side is dominant at a given price.</p>

    <p>By default, each <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> Input specifies 3 percentages: .25, .50, .75 (25%, 50%, 75%), and by default, each <b>Column # Actual Volume Compare Thresholds</b> Input specifies 3 values: 100, 200, 300.</p> 

    <p>The Color Inputs are labeled:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Column # Range 3 Up Color</b></li>
        <li><b>Column # Range 2 Up Color</b></li>
        <li><b>Column # Range 1 Up Color</b></li>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#BackgroundColoringMethodsLogic">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>This section gives information on how the background is colored for each setting in the <b>Column # Background Coloring Method</b> Input.</p>

        <p>The background location (Bid  side, Ask side, or both) within a column is not only dependent on the <a href="#BackgroundTypes">Column # Background Type</a>, but also on the setting for the <b>Column # Background Coloring Method</b>.</p>

        <p>Therefore, it is possible to see changes to the Numbers Bars background location based on the combination of these settings. This occurs because the background area for a column is composed of two sides, the Bid side on the left and the Ask side on the right.</p>

        <p>Some settings use both of these together as a single entity, and other settings deal with them separately. The result is that if the settings require coloring over the entire bar, then both sides are used as a single background, but if the coloring can be set to one side or the other (or differently for both), then the background is drawn appropriately for that case.</p>

        <p>The following examples show the Numbers Bar with the <b>Column # Numbers Bars Text</b> set to <b>Bid Vol x Ask Vol</b> and three different settings for the <b>Column # Background Type</b> in the rows and three different settings for the <b>Column # Background Coloring Method</b> in the columns.</p>

            <p>This section explains the <b>Based On Dominant Side AskVol BidVol Percentage</b> <a href="#BackgroundColoringMethods">Background Coloring Method</a>.</p>

            <p>This background coloring uses a <em>Percentage Value</em>. The percentage is based on the Ask or Bid volume at the given price in comparison to the Bid or Ask Volume at the given price. For the Bid: <b>Bid Percentage = <em>Bid Volume at Price</em> / <em>Ask Volume at Price</em></b>. For the Ask: <b>Ask Percentage = <em>Ask Volume at Price</em> / <em>Bid Volume at Price</em></b>.</p>

            <p>Since the Background Coloring is performed using a <em>Percentage Value</em> calculated from Ask Volume/Bid Volume or Bid Volume/Ask Volume and the purpose of this text coloring method is to emphasize the more dominant side, the recommended <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> Input setting values are: <em>1.25, 1.50, 2.0</em>.</p>

            <p>While these are the recommended values, the specific differences in the Bid and Ask Volumes should be analyzed in order to determine the best <b>Column # Percent Compare Threshold</b> Input settings to use.  Keep in mind with these recommended percentages, the less dominant side (when displayed using a Split <b>Background Type</b>) whether the Ask Volume or Bid Volume side, will always map to the <b> Column # Up/Down Range 0 Color</b> because it will always be less than 100% of the other side.</p>

            <p>In the case where the Bid Volume and Ask Volume at the same price level are both zero, the percentage is calculated to be 0. In the case where only the Bid or Ask Volume which is the denominator in the calculation is 0, the <b>Column # Up/Down Range 3 Color</b> will be used.</p>

            <p>When the Numbers Bars <a href="#BackgroundTypes">Background Type</a> is set to display only a single Numbers Bar background, then the <b>Up</b> Colors are used if the Ask Volume is dominant or equivalent at the given price (the Ask Volume is greater than or equal to the Bid Volume at that price), and the <b>Down</b> Colors are used if the Bid Volume is dominant at the given price (the Bid Volume is greater than the Ask Volume at that price).</p>

            <p>When the Numbers Bars <a href="#BackgroundTypes">Background Type</a> is set to one of the <b>Split</b> options that displays the Numbers Bars Background on both sides, then the <b>Up</b> Colors are used for the Ask side, and the <b>Down</b> colors are used for the Bid Side.</p>

            <p>The following are the rules for determining which specific Color Input is used:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Column # Range 3 Up Color</b>: This color is used when an <b>Up</b> color is being used and the Percentage Value is greater than or equal to the third threshold value in the <a href="#Input_ColumnNumberCompareThresholds">Column # Percent Compare Threshold</a> Input setting.</li>

            <p>Since the Background Coloring is performed using a <em>Percentage Value</em> calculated from Ask Volume/Previous Bid Volume or Bid Volume/Next Ask Volume and the purpose of this background coloring method is to emphasize the more dominant side, the recommended <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> Input setting values are: <em>1.25, 1.50, 2.0</em>.</p>

            <p>While these are the recommended values, the specific differences in the Bid and Ask Volumes should be analyzed in order to determine the best <b>Column # Percent Compare Threshold</b> Input settings to use.</p>

            <p>In the case where only the Bid or Ask Volume which is the denominator in the calculation is 0, then the background will not be drawn. If the Input for <b>Enable Diagonal Zero Bid/Ask Compares</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>, then the denominator is set to a value of <b>1</b> and the Percent Calculation determined using this value.</p>

            <p>This background coloring uses a <em>Diagonal Difference Percentage</em>. This percentage is based on the volume difference between the Ask Volume and the diagonal Bid Volume divided by the range of diagonal volumes within the entire bar. For the Bid: <b>Bid Percentage = (<em>Ask Volume at Next Price - Bid Volume at the Given Price</em> - <em>Minimum Diagonal Volume Difference</em>) / (<em>Maximum Diagonal Volume Difference</em> - <em>Minimum Diagonal Volume Difference</em>)</b>.

            <p>The Maximum Diagonal Volume Difference is found by reviewing all of the price points and finding the most positive value of the Ask Volume at a given price minus the Bid Volume at the previous price.

                <p>If both the Ask and Bid sides are not calculated (this occurs when the data happens to result in only one value for all of the diagonal differences, or if there are two or fewer price points represented in a bar) and the Numbers Bars <b>Background Type</b> is <em>not</em> set to <b>Background on Dominant Side</b> or <b>Background on Dominant Side Outline</b>, then the background is drawn using the <a href="#Input_DefaultBackgroundColor">Default Background Color</a>.</p>

                <p>If both the Ask and Bid sides are not calculated, and the Numbers Bars <b>Background Type</b> is set to <b>Background on Dominant Side</b> or <b>Background on Dominant Side Outline</b> then the background is not drawn.</p>
            </section>

            <p>When the Numbers Bars <a href="#BackgroundTypes">Background Type</a> is set to display both the Ask and the Bid Numbers Bar background separately, the following occurs to determine the use of <b>Up</b> or <b>Down</b> colors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On the Bid Side:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Up</b> colors are used if the difference between the Ask Volume at the next price and the Bid Volume at the given price is positive.</li>
                        <li><b>Down</b> colors are used if the difference between the Ask Volume at the next price and the Bid Volume at the given price is negative</li>
                        <li>The background is not drawn at the highest price of the bar where the Ask Volume at the next price is non-existent (NULL) unless the <a href="#Input_EnableDiagonalZeroBidAskCompares">Enable Diagonal Zero Bid/Ask Compares</a> Input is set to <b>Yes</b>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>On the Ask Side:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Up</b> colors are used if the difference between the Ask Volume at the given price and the Bid Volume at the previous price is positive.</li>
                        <li><b>Down</b> colors are used if the difference between the Ask Volume at the given price and the Bid Volume at the previous price is negative.</li>
                        <li>The background is not drawn at the lowest price of the bar where the Bid Volume at the previous price is non-existent (NULL), unless the <a href="#Input_EnableDiagonalZeroBidAskCompares">Enable Diagonal Zero Bid/Ask Compares</a> Input is set to <b>Yes</b>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>When a bar has data at only two or fewer price points, the difference between the Maximum Diagonal Volume Difference and the Minimum Diagonal Volume Difference is 0. Therefore, if the <b>Background Type</b> is set to a Split profile, then the background is drawn with a calculated Percentage of 0 for both the Ask and Bid sides, otherwise, no backgrounds are drawn.</p>

            <p>The following are the rules for determining which specific Color Input is used:</p>

The percentage is based on the Ask or Bid volume at price in comparison to the Previous Bid or Next Ask Volume at price. For the Bid: <b>Bid Percentage = <em>Bid Volume at Price</em> / <em>Ask Volume at Next Price</em></b>. For the Ask: <b>Ask Percentage = <em>Ask Volume at Price</em> / <em>Bid Volume at Previous Price</em></b>.</p>

            <p>Since the Background Coloring is performed using a <em>Percentage Value</em> calculated from Ask Volume/Previous Bid Volume or Bid Volume/Next Ask Volume and the purpose of this background coloring method is to emphasize the more dominant side, the recommended <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> Input setting values are: <em>1.25, 1.50, 2.0</em>.</p>

            <p>While these are the recommended values, the specific differences in the Bid and Ask Volumes should be analyzed in order to determine the best <b>Column # Percent Compare Threshold</b> Input settings to use.</p>

            <p>In the case where the Bid or Ask Volume in a calculation is 0, or not available (as in at the top of the bar where the Next Ask volume does not exist), the information is considered non-dominant for that side.</p>

            <p>When the Numbers Bars <a href="#BackgroundTypes">Background Type</a> is set to display only a single Numbers Bar background, the following sequence is followed to determine the <b>Up</b> or <b>Down</b> colors:</p>

            <p>This background coloring uses a <em>Percentage Value</em>. The percentage is based on the Ask Volume minus the Bid volume (Delta) at a price level in comparison to the largest Delta within the entire bar for the dominant side at the given price level. Since we are always using the Ask Volume minus the Bid Volume, the largest positive value is Ask dominant, and the largest negative value is Bid dominant. If the Bid is dominant, then the Bid Percentage is calculated as: <b>Bid Percentage = <em>Ask Volume (at price) - Bid Volume (at price)</em> / <em>Largest Negative Value (all prices in bar)</em></b>. If the Ask is dominant, then the Ask Percentage is calculated as: <b>Ask Percentage = <em>Ask Volume (at price) - Bid Volume (at price)</em> / <em>Largest Positive Value (all prices in bar)</em></b>.</p>

            <p>Since the Background Coloring is performed using a <em>Percentage Value</em> calculated from Ask Volume - Bid Volume / Largest Positive/Negative Delta the recommended <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> Input setting values are: <em>.25, .50, .75</em>.</p>

            <p>This section explains the <b>Based On AskVol/BidVol Percentage</b> <a href="#TextColoringMethods">Text Coloring Method</a>.</p>

            <p>This text coloring uses a <em>Percentage Value</em>. The percentage is based on the Ask or Bid volume at a given price in comparison to the largest Ask or Bid volume across all prices for the bar. For the Ask: <b>Ask Percentage = <em>Ask Volume at given Price</em> / <em>Largest Ask Volume at any price within bar</em></b>. For the Bid: <b>Bid Percentage = <em>Bid Volume at Given Price</em> / <em>Largest Bid Volume at any Price within Bar</em></b>.</p>

            <p>Since the Text Coloring is performed using a <em>Percentage Value</em> the recommended <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> Input setting values are: <em>.25, .50, .75</em>.</p>

            <p>When a single Text Value is being displayed, <b>Up</b> colors are used if the Ask Volume is dominant at the given price (the Ask Volume is greater than the Bid Volume at the given price), and <b>Down</b> colors are used if the Bid Volume is dominant at the given price (the Bid Volume is greater than the Ask Volume at the given price). If the Ask Volume equals the Bid Volume at the given price, then <b>Up</b> colors are used if the Total Ask Volume for the entire bar is greater than or equal to the Total Bid Volume for the entire bar; and <b>Down</b> colors are used if the Total Bid Volume for the entire bar is greater than the Total Ask Volume for the entire bar.</p>

            <p>When both the Ask and Bid Side Text Values are displayed, then the <b>Up</b> colors are used for the Ask side when the Ask is dominant (the Ask Volume is greater than the Bid Volume at the given price), and the <b>Down</b> colors are used for the Bid side when the Bid is dominant (the Bid Volume is greater than the Ask Volume at the given price). If the Ask Volume equals the Bid Volume at the given price, then the <b>Up</b> colors are used if the Total Ask Volume for the entire bar is greater than or equal to the Total Bid Volume for the entire bar; and the <b>Down</b> colors are used if the Total Bid Volume for the entire bar is greater than the Total AskVolume for the entire bar. The opposing side (Ask or Bid) that is not dominant at the given price will use the <b>Default Text Color</b>.</p>

            <p>This section explains the <b>Based On Dominant Side AskVol BidVol Percentage</b> <a href="#TextColoringMethods">Text Coloring Method</a>. </p>

            <p>This text coloring uses a <em>Percentage Value</em>. The percentage is based on the Ask or Bid volume at the given price in comparison to the Bid or Ask Volume at the given price. For the Bid: <b>Bid Percentage = <em>Bid Volume at Price</em> / <em>Ask Volume at Price</em></b>. For the Ask: <b>Ask Percentage = <em>Ask Volume at Price</em> / <em>Bid Volume at Price</em></b>.</p>

            <p>Since the Text Coloring is performed using a <em>Percentage Value</em> calculated from Ask Volume/Bid Volume or Bid Volume/Ask Volume and the purpose of this text coloring method is to emphasize the more dominant side, the recommended <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> Input setting values are: <em>1.25, 1.50, 2.0</em>.</p>

            <p>While these are the recommended values, the specific differences in the Bid and Ask Volumes should be analyzed in order to determine the best <b>Column # Percent Compare Threshold</b> Input settings to use.</p>

            <p>In the case where the Bid Volume and Ask Volume at the same price level are both zero, the percentage is calculated to be 0. In the case where the Bid/Ask Volume which is the denominator in the calculation is 0, the <b>Column # Up/Down Range 3 Color</b> will always be used.</p>

            <p>When a single Text Value is being displayed, then the <b>Up</b> colors are used if the Ask Volume is dominant or equivalent at the given price (the Ask Volume is greater than or equal to the Bid Volume at that price), and the <b>Down</b> colors are used if the Bid Volume is dominant at the given price (the Bid Volume is greater than the Ask Volume at that price).</p>

            <p>When both the Ask and Bid Side Text Values are displayed, then the <b>Up</b> colors are used for the Ask side when the Ask Volume is dominant or equivalent at the given price (the Ask Volume is greater than or equal to the Bid Volume at that price), and the <b>Down</b> colors are used for the Bid side when the Bid Volume is dominant at the given price (the Bid Volume is greater than the Ask Volume at that price).</p>

            <p>The following are the rules for determining which specific Color Input is used:</p>

For the Ask: <b>Ask Percentage = <em>Ask Volume at the given price</em> / <em>Bid Volume at the previous price</em></b>.</p>

            <p>Since the Text Coloring is performed using a <em>Percentage Value</em> calculated from Ask Volume/Previous Bid Volume or Bid Volume/Next Ask Volume and the purpose of this text coloring method is to emphasize the more dominant side, the recommended <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> Input setting values are: <em>1.25, 1.50, 2.0</em>.</p>

            <p>While these are the recommended values, the specific differences in the Bid and Ask Volumes should be analyzed in order to determine the best <b>Column # Percent Compare Threshold</b> Input settings to use.</p>

            <p>In the case where only the Bid or Ask Volume which is the denominator in the calculation is 0, the <b>Column # Up/Down Range 3 Color</b> will be used.</p>

            <p>When a single Text Value is being displayed, the following sequence is followed to determine the <b>Up</b> or <b>Down</b> colors:</p>
            <section class="h5">
                <p>Volume comparisons are performed to see if either the Ask or the Bid side are exclusively dominant at the given price. If one is exclusively dominant, then the following are the results:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Up</b> colors are used if the Ask Volume is exclusively dominant (the Ask Volume at the given price is greater than or equal to the Bid Volume at the Previous Price and the Bid Volume at the given price is less than the Ask Volume at the next price).</li>

                </ul>
                <p>If neither the Ask or Bid side is exclusively diagonally dominant (as determined above) and instead they are both diagonally dominant (the Bid Volume at the given price is greater than the Ask Volume at the next price point, and the Ask Volume at the given price is greater than or equal to the Bid Volume at the previous price point), then the Ask Percentage (as defined above) is compared to the Bid Percentage (as defined above) with the following results:</p>

            </section>

            <p>When both the Ask and Bid Side Text Values are displayed, then the <b>Up</b> Colors are used for the Ask side when the Ask side is dominant; and the <b>Down</b> colors are used for the Bid Side when the Bid side is dominant.

In order to view the data that drives the coloring of the text for this Numbers Bar, use the <b>Ask Bid Vol Difference Diagonal</b> <a href="#TextTypes">Numbers Bar Text Type</a>.</p>

            <p>This Text Coloring uses a <em>Diagonal Difference Percentage</em>. This percentage is based on the volume difference between the Ask Volume and the diagonal Bid Volume divided by the range of diagonal volumes within the entire bar. For the Bid: <b>Bid Percentage = (<em>Ask Volume at Next Price - Bid Volume at the Given Price</em> - <em>Minimum Diagonal Volume Difference</em>) / (<em>Maximum Diagonal Volume Difference</em> - <em>Minimum Diagonal Volume Difference</em>)</b>.

            <p>The Maximum Diagonal Volume Difference is found by reviewing all of the price points and finding the most positive value of the Ask Volume at a given price minus the Bid Volume at the previous price.

            <p>This Text Coloring uses a <em>Diagonal Percentage Value</em>. The percentage is based on the Ask or Bid volume at price in comparison to the Previous Bid or Next Ask Volume at price. For the Bid: <b>Bid Percentage = <em>Bid Volume at the given price</em> / <em>Ask Volume at the next price</em></b>. For the Ask: <b>Ask Percentage = <em>Ask Volume at the given price</em> / <em>Bid Volume at the previous price</em></b>.</p>

            <p>Since the Text Coloring is performed using a <em>Percentage Value</em> calculated from Ask Volume/Previous Bid Volume or Bid Volume/Next Ask Volume, the recommended <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> Input setting values are: <em>1.25, 1.50, 2.0</em>.</p>

            <p>While these are the recommended values, the specific differences in the Bid and Ask Volumes should be analyzed in order to determine the best <b>Column # Percent Compare Threshold</b> Input settings to use.</p>

            <p>In the case where only the Bid or Ask Volume which is the denominator in the calculation is 0, the <b>Column # Up/Down Range 3 Color</b> will be used.</p>

            <p>When a single Text Value is being displayed, the following sequence is followed to determine the <b>Up</b> or <b>Down</b> colors:</p>
            <section class="h5">
                <p>Volume comparisons are performed to see if either the Ask or the Bid side are exclusively dominant at the given price. If one is exclusively dominant, then the following are the results:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Up</b> colors are used if the Ask Volume is exclusively dominant (the Ask Volume at the given price is greater than or equal to the Bid Volume at the Previous Price and the Bid Volume at the given price is less than the Ask Volume at the next price).</li>
                    <li><b>Down</b> colors are used if the Bid Volume is exclusively dominant (the Bid Volume at the given price is greater than the Ask Volume at the next price and the Ask Volume at the given price is less than the Bid Volume at the previous price).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If neither the Ask or Bid side is exclusively diagonally dominant (as determined above) and instead they are both diagonally dominant (the Bid Volume at the given price is greater than the Ask Volume at the next price point, and the Ask Volume at the given price is greater than or equal to the Bid Volume at the previous price point), then the Ask Percentage (as defined above) is compared to the Bid Percentage (as defined above) with the following results:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Up</b> colors are used if the Ask Percentage is greater than or equal to the Bid Percentage.</li>
                    <li><b>Down</b> colors are used if the Bid Percentage is greater than the Ask Percentage.</li>
                </ul>

            </section>

            <p>When both the Ask and Bid Side Text Values are displayed, then the <b>Up</b> Colors are used for the Ask side and the <b>Down</b> colors are used for the Bid Side.

            <p>This section explains the <b>Based on AskVol BidVol Difference Percentage of Max Dominant Side</b> <a href="#TextColoringMethods">Text Coloring Method</a>.</p>

            <p>This text coloring uses a <em>Percentage Value</em>. The percentage is based on the Ask Volume minus the Bid volume (Delta) at a price level in comparison to the largest Delta within the entire bar for the dominant side at the given price level. Since we are always using the Ask Volume minus the Bid Volume, the largest positive value is Ask dominant, and the largest negative value is Bid dominant. If the Bid is dominant, then the Bid Percentage is calculated as: <b>Bid Percentage = <em>Ask Volume (at price) - Bid Volume (at price)</em> / <em>Largest Negative Value (all prices in bar)</em></b>. If the Ask is dominant, then the Ask Percentage is calculated as: <b>Ask Percentage = <em>Ask Volume (at price) - Bid Volume (at price)</em> / <em>Largest Positive Value (all prices in bar)</em></b>.</p>

            <p>Since the Background Coloring is performed using a <em>Percentage Value</em> calculated from Ask Volume - Bid Volume / Largest Positive/Negative Delta, the recommended <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> Input setting values are: <em>.25, .50, .75</em>, as the values for either side will always be in the range of 0.0 - 1.0.</p>

    <p> Therefore, a diagonal comparison method needs to be done. Follow these instructions to set up the Numbers Bars for a diagonal comparison.</p>

    <p> The instructions below should be considered an example only because there are various possible configurations. This should give you a good understanding of what is necessary for reasonable diagonal comparison type of configuration. </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Add the Numbers Bars study to the chart according to the instructions in the <a href="#Instructions">Step-By-Step Instructions</a> section on this page. Stop at the step that opens the  Study Settings window. Continue with the instructions below.</li>

        <li>Select the <b>Settings and Inputs</b> tab.</li>

        <li> Set the <b>Column 1 Numbers Bars Text</b> Input to <b>Bid Vol x Ask Vol</b>. </li>

        <li> The <b>Column 1 Background Type </b> Input can be set to anything because it is not used in this example. </li>

        <li> Set  the <b>Column 1 Background Coloring Method</b> Input to <b>None-Transparent</b>. </li>

        <li> Set the <b>Column 1 Text Coloring Method</b> Input to <b>Based on Diagonal Dominant Side AskVol BidVol Percentage</b>.</li>

        <li> Set the <b>Column 1 Range 0 Up Color</b>  Color Input to a neutral color which does not indicate any emphasis of the text.  You may want to make this the same as the chart text color.
        </li>

        <li> Set the  <b>Column 1 Range 0 Down Color</b>  Color Input to a neutral color which does not indicate any emphasis of the text.  You may want to make this the same as the chart text color.</li>

        <li>Set the <a href="#Input_ColumnNumberCompareThresholds">Column 1 Percent Compare Thresholds</a> Input as follows: <b><em>1.5, 2, 3</em></b>. These represent percentages (150%, 200%, 300%). Use whatever percentages that you require. This is only an example.
            <br> <br>
            The first percentage corresponds to the <b>Column 1 Range 1 Up/Down Color</b>. The  second percentage corresponds to the <b>Column 1 Range 2 Up/Down Color</b>. The third percentage corresponds to the <b>Column 1 Range 3 Up/Down Color</b>. For more detailed explanation about how these percentages are used to color the text, refer to the specific text coloring option within the <a href="#ColorSettingsAndLogicForNumbersBars">Color Settings and Logic for Numbers Bars</a> section. </li>

        <li> Set the other <b>Column 1  Range 1, 2, 3 Up/Down Color</b>  Color Inputs to what you require for coloring.  Each of these color settings corresponds with the 3 <b>Column 1 Percent Compare Thresholds</b> Input percentages.</li>

        <li> Press <b>OK </b> to close the Study Settings window.</li>

        <li>Press <b>OK</b> to close the Chart Studies window.</li>

        <li>Continue  with the remaining relevant instructions in the <a href="#Instructions">Step-By-Step Instructions</a> section.</li>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#DiagonalComparisonExample">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>
        
        <p>The diagonal comparisons for Numbers Bars considers the Numbers Bars as consisting of two sides - the <b>Bid</b> side on the left and the <b>Ask</b> side on the right. The calculations are then performed for each side separately. When a comparison is made for the <b>Bid</b> side, the <b>Bid Volume</b> at the current price point of interest is compared against the <b>Ask Volume</b> at the next price point above the current price point for the <b>Bid Volume</b>. When a comparison is made for the <b>Ask</b> side, the <b>Ask Volume</b> at the current price point of interest is compared against the <b>Bid Volume</b> at the previous price point below the current price point for the <b>Ask Volume</b>.</p> 

        <p>The image below has the <a href="#Input_ColumnNumberNumbersBarsText">Column # Numbers Bars Text</a> set to <b>Bid Vol x Ask Vol</b>, which displays the <b>Bid Volume</b> on the left and the <b>Ask Volume</b> on the right, and shows the values for each side that will be compared connected by an arrow. The Red Arrow shows the Bid comparison, in which the <b>Bid Volume</b> (48) at the given price is compared to the <b>Ask Volume</b> at the next higher price point (359). The Green Arrow shows the Ask comparison, in which the <b>Ask Volume</b> (532) at the given price is compared to the <b>Bid Volume</b> at the previous lower price point (1008).</p>

        <p>For this particular bar, if the Numbers Bars <a href="#Input_ColumnNumberBackgroundType">Column # Background Type</a> is set to <b>Background on Dominant Side</b> or <b>Background on Dominant Side Outline</b> and the <a href="backgroundcoloringmethods.html">Numbers Bars Background Coloring Methods</a> is set to <b>Based On Diagonal Dominant Side Ask Vol Bid Vol Percentage</b> and the <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> is set to <b>2.5, 5.0, 7.5</b>, then the following image shows the coloring for this particular time period:</p>

        <p>Since this is a diagonal comparison and the <b>Column # Background type</b> is set to <b>Background on Dominant Side</b> or <b>Backround on Dominant Side Outline</b>, the decision to use a background coloring is determined for each side (Bid side and Ask Side) individually. Starting at the highest price (top) and working down, the following are the results for the dominant decision:
        <ul>
            <li>Price Point A (0 | 56)
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bid Volume = 0</b>: No comparison is performed since there is no <b>Ask Volume</b> at the next higher price point. Therefore this is not considered dominant.</li>
                    <li><b>Ask Volume = 56</b>: Is 56 &gt; 293? Since this is False, this is not dominant and there is no background coloring.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Price Point B (293 | 359)
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bid Volume = 293</b>: Is 293 &gt; 56? Since this is True, this is dominant and the background coloring is used.</li>
                    <li><b>Ask Volume = 359</b>: Is 359 &gt; 48? Since this is True, this is dominant and the background coloring is used.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Price Point C (48 | 532)
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bid Volume = 48</b>: Is 48 &gt; 359? Since this is False, this is not dominant and there is no background coloring.</li>
                    <li><b>Ask Volume = 532</b>: Is 532 &gt; 1008? Since this is False, this is not dominant and there is no backgorund coloring.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Price Point D (1008 | 830)
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bid Volume = 1008</b>: Is 1008 &gt; 532? Since this is True, this is dominant and the background coloring is used.</li>
                    <li><b>Ask Volume = 830</b>: Is 830 &gt; 682? Since this is True, this is dominant and the background coloring is used.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Price Point E (682 | 452)
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bid Volume = 682</b>: Is 682 &gt; 830? Since this is False, this is not dominant and there is no background coloring.</li>
                    <li><b>Ask Volume = 452</b>: Is 452 &gt; 16? Since this is True, this is dominant and the background coloring is used.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Price Point F (16 | 0)
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bid Volume = 16</b>: Is 16 &gt; 452? Since this is False, this is not dominant and there is no background coloring.</li>
                    <li><b>Ask Volume = 0</b>: No comparison is performed since there is no <b>Bid Volume</b> at the next lower price point. Therefore this is not considered dominant.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following image shows the progression of the calculations that goes into determining the background coloring in the image above. The numbers on the left are the input <b>Bid Volume</b> and <b>Ask Volume</b> from the time period shown above. The numbers in the middle show the calculation that will take place at each price point for each side of the bar. The numbers on the right are the final calculated values. Note the range of numbers on the right that go from 0.04 to 28.25. It is this range that drives the decision to enter the <b>Column # Percent Compare Thresholds</b> at <b>2.5, 5.0, 7.5</b>.</p>

        <p>The pullback column represents a standard Numbers Bar, displayed at the end of the chart, which is based upon the Volume at Price data since the most recent new High or Low on the last bar in the chart. On the last bar in the chart, if a new High/Low is made or there is a new bar added to the chart, the pullback column data is reset and the Volume at Price data is accumulated from that point going forward. </p>

        <p>Upon a new High or Low, the pullback column will consist of a single price level. If the market trades one tick away from the High, then the pullback column will consist of 2 price tick levels, a tick at the High price and 1 tick below it.</p>

    <p>Numbers Bars use text within each bar. Therefore, you may need to adjust the Font, Style or Size used by them.</p>

    <p>To change the font size, first select which method is desired for determining the font size. This is controlled in the Input for <b>Font Size Mode</b>. There are two options available and each of these is described in more detail below.</p>

    <p>It is necessary to understand that, in general, the Numbers Bars study is displaying a large amount of information and it may be necessary to change the bar spacing and the scale of the chart in order to adequately view the desired information. It is not possible to define a single view that works for all situations, therefore it may be necessary to make changes based on the particular view of the data at any given time.</p>

   <p> Any remaining zero volume at an entire price level, would just be the result of no trading volume at those price levels which is not a common condition.</p>
   
   <p>  If you see repeating volume values like in the chart image below, then this means Sierra Chart is not set to a tick by tick data configuration. For instructions to do this, refer to  <a href="index6d53.html?page=doc/TickbyTickDataConfiguration.php" >Tick by Tick Data Configuration</a>.</p>

    <p>Trade and Trade Volume filtering is supported with Numbers Bars.  There are two filtering methods available.</p>

    <p>One method only filters out the volume of trades that are below and/or above the specified values. To set this, select <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Data Limiting</b>. Use the <b>Volume Filter &gt;&gt; Exclude &gt;=</b> and the <b>Volume Filter &gt;&gt; Exclude &lt;=</b> settings to set the volume that you want to exclude.  The trades and trade prices will still be included in the chart. Make sure the <b> Filter Trade Completely </b> option is disabled.</p>

    <p> The second method completely filters out the trades including the volume of those trades, where the volume is below and/or above the specified values. To set this, select <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Data Limiting</b>. Use the <b>Volume Filter &gt;&gt; Exclude &gt;=</b> and the <b>Volume Filter &gt;&gt; Exclude &lt;=</b> settings to set the volume that you want to exclude. Enable the <b> Filter Trade Completely </b> option. </p>

    <p>It is <em>essential</em> that when using Volume Filtering, that you set Sierra Chart to a <a href="index6d53.html?page=doc/TickbyTickDataConfiguration.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tick by Tick Data Configuration</a>. </p>

    <p>It is supported to use multiple copies of the Numbers Bars study on a single chart. This may be required in order to get different colors or variations that are not capable with the single Numbers Bars study.</p>

    <p>The following instructions create an example with two Numbers Bars studies that will highlight the Maximum Bid Volume in one color and the Maximum Ask Volume in another color in the first column. Note that if the Maximum Bid and Maximum Ask occur at the same price level and if the Width for drawing the highlight is the same for both studies, then the study that is lower in the Study Selection window will be the color that is displayed, as it is on top of the other highlight. Changing the width of the lower listed study to a larger width will allow both colors to be seen, but may not be visually appealing. User preference must be used in this case to determine what option is best.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Add the first Numbers Bars study to the chart. Ensure that there is data displayed in Column 1, otherwise setup this copy of the Numbers Bars study as desired with the addition of the following:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Transparent Text Background</b>: When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b>, the background of the text values is transparent and will be the same as the chart background color. </li>

            <li><b>Text Background Color</b>: This Input sets the background color of the displayed text values.</li>

            <li><b>Show Pullback Column Values</b>: When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b>, then the Pullback column values for each of the displayed calculated values rows will be calculated and displayed. The pullback column is displayed after the very last bar in the chart. </li>

            <li><b>Font Size</b>: This Input sets the font size of the text values. The default is 0. When this is set to 0, the font size is automatically set and will be the same size as the Chart Text Font set through <a href="index5795.html?page=doc/GraphicsSettings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graphics Settings</a>.</li>

            <li><b>Display Percent Values as Decimal or Percentage</b>: This Input controls whether subgraphs that are defined as percentages are displayed as decimal values (.45) or as percentages (45.00%).</li>

            <li><b>Number of Decimal Places for Percent Values When Displayed as Decimal</b>: When the Input for <b>Display Percent Values as Decimal or Percentage</b> is set to <b>Decimal</b> then this Input controls the number of decimal places to which the values will be displayed. For example, an Input of 4 would display the data as <b>.1234</b>.</li>

            <li><b>Labels On Right</b>: When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b>,  descriptive row labels will be drawn on the right side of the chart.</li>

            <li><b>Allow Values To Overlap Labels</b>: When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b>, this will draw the row values even if they are within the left side label area. Another option to be aware of is that the Subgraph <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#ShortName" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Short Name</a> setting can be set to an alternative name in order to rename the row label and make it shorter. This allows the label area to be smaller. The size of the label area is determined by the largest label.</li>

            <li><b>Subgraph Display Order</b>:  This study Input provides a means by which the available Calculated Values rows can have their display order changed. This Input is a <em>comma separated</em> list of study Subgraph numbers (1, 2, 3, ...). By default this Input is blank, which displays the rows in the default order.  This is according to the position a particular Calculated Value is at in the list of Subgraphs on the <b>Subgraphs</b> tab of the <b>Study Settings</b> window for the   <b>Numbers Bars Calculated Values</b> study. By entering a list of Subgraph numbers for this Input, those Subgraphs will be displayed in the specified order. Any Subgraphs set with a  <b> Visible </b> Draw Style not specified in the list, will be displayed after those specified.</li>

            <li><b>Reference Other Intraday Chart</b>: In the case where you want to display a <b>Numbers Bars Calculated  Values </b> study based upon  <a href="#VolumeFiltering">Volume Filtering</a> which is different than the chart the study applied to, then set this Input to Yes. Use the <b>Other Intraday Chart Reference</b> Study Input to select the particular chart you want to reference which has the Volume Filtering settings that you require.</li>

            <li><b>Other Intraday Chart Reference</b>:  Refer to the description for <b>Reference Other Intraday Chart</b>.</li>

            <li><b> Reset Day Calculations at Both Session Start Times</b>: This  Input when set to Yes will cause the <a href="#CalculatedValuesSubgraphDescriptions">Numbers Bars Calculated Values Subgraphs</a> which are based on a trading day and reset at the beginning of the trading day, to also be reset at the  <b>Evening Start Time</b> when the chart is set to use the Evening Session. For additional information, refer to <a href="index4ec1.html?page=doc/SessionTimes.php">Session Times</a>.</li>

            <li><b>Include Highest Bid/Lowest Ask in Diagonal Comparisons</b>: When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b> the calculations that use Diagonal Comparisons will include the data that is found at the Highest Bid Price and the Lowest Ask Price.</li>

            <li><b>Color Background Based on Value Percentage</b>: When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b> the background of each calculated value is color coded according to the values set in the <b>Percent Compare Thresholds</b> and <b>Range # Up/Down Color</b>. For more information, refer to <a href="#CalculatedValuesBackgroundColoringLogic">Calculated Values Background Coloring Logic</a>. This setting overrides the <b>Transparent Text Background</b> and <b>Text Background Color</b> Inputs.
            <br><br>
            When the <b>Color Background Based on Value Percentage</b> Input is set to <b>Yes</b>, the background coloring of the last cell/bar in the chart has special handling while the bar is still developing (not closed). In particular, if the value exceeds the established Highest or Lowest values in the row, then it will not become the new Highest or Lowest value, but it will be colored using the Range 3 Up/Down colors. For more information, refer to <a href="#CalculatedValuesBackgroundColoringLogic">Calculated Values Background Coloring Logic</a>.
            </li>

            <li><b>Determine Maximum/Minimum Values for Background From</b>: When <b>Color Background Based on Value Percentage</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>, then this Input determines whether the Maximum and Minimum values for the background coloring percentage calculations is done for all the bars or resets for each day. This Input affects all subgraphs, not only those that reset on a daily basis. This Input has the following options:

                <ul>
                    <li><b>All Data</b>: This option establishes a single Maximum and Minimum value from all the data that is loaded for the chart.</li>

                    <li><b>Daily Data</b>: This option establishes a Maximum and Minimum value for each day. When the Input for <b>Reset Day Calculations at Both Session Start Times</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>, then the Maximum and Minimum value will be determined separately for each Day and Evening Session, otherwise the Maximum and Minimum value will be determined for the Day and Evening Sessions together.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Percent Compare Thresholds</b>: This Input sets the values to be used for determining the coloring of the background of each calculated value when the <b>Color Background Based on Value Percentage</b> Input is set to <b>Yes</b>.</li>

            <li><b>Range # Up Color</b>: These are the colors that are used for the background for positive values when the <b>Color Background Based on Value Percentage</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>. For more information, refer to <a href="#CalculatedValuesBackgroundColoringLogic">Calculated Values Background Coloring Logic</a>.</li>

            <li><b>Range # Down Color</b>: These are the colors that are used for the background for negative values when the <b>Color Background Based on Value Percentage</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>. For more information, refer to <a href="#CalculatedValuesBackgroundColoringLogic">Calculated Values Background Coloring Logic</a>.</li>

            <li><b>Use Different Colors for Pullback and Labels</b>: When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b> the color of the Labels and the text in the Pullback Column will use the value set in <b>Pullback and Labels Text Color</b>. Otherwise, the Labels and text in the Pullback Column use the color defined for each subgraph.</li>

            <li><b>Pullback and Labels Text Color</b>: This is the color that is used for the Labels and the text in the Pullback Column when the <b>Use Different Colors for Pullback and Labels</b> Input is set to <b>Yes</b>.</li>

            <li><b>Color Pullback Column Background Based on Positive/Negative</b>: When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b> and the <b>Show Pullback Column Values</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>, then the pullback column background will be colored based on whether the value is Positive or Negative. If the value is positive, then the background will be colored the <b>Range 3 Up Color</b>. If the value is negative, then the background will be colored the <b>Range 3 Down Color</b>.</li>

            <li><b>Volume Display Multiplier</b>: This Input modifies the number of digits that are displayed for the Volume data in the Numbers Bars Calculated Values studies. The default value of <b>1</b> displays the data with no modifications. Selecting a value other than 1 will shift the digits to the right, thereby displaying fewer total digits. For example, a Volume of <b>12345</b> with a Volume Display Multiplier of <b>1</b> (full volume data) will display as <b>1234</b> with a Volume Display Multiplier of <b>0.1</b>. And will display <b>123</b> will a Volume Display Multiplier of <b>0.01</b>. Once the number of digits is exhausted the volume will display as <b>0</b>.</li>

            <li><b>Use Default Number Formatting for All Subgraphs</b>: When this Input is set to <b>Yes</b> the number formatting for all subgraphs will use the <b>Value Format</b> set for the study. Otherwise, the number formatting for specialized values will use their default format. Refer to the information in the <a href="#CalculatedValuesNumberFormat"> Calculated Values Number Format</a> section for information on which subgraphs use specialized formatting.</li>

This absolute value is then multiplied by 100.
                <br> 
                <br>
                Otherwise,  if the  <em>Ask Volume Bid Volume Difference  Low</em> was more recently decreased as compared to the <em>Ask Volume Bid Volume Difference  High</em> being more recently increased, then  <em>Finish AskVol BidVol Diff %</em> equals  the absolute value of the <em>Finish AskVol BidVol Diff</em> for the current bar divided by the <em>Ask Volume Bid Volume Difference Low</em> for the current bar. This absolute value is then multiplied by 100. 
            </li>       

            <li><b>Volume/Sec</b>: This gives the Total Volume per Second for the bar. This is calculated by taking the total volume for the bar and dividing by the number of seconds for the bar.</li>

            <li><b>Cumulative Delta Minus Delta</b>: For each bar in the chart, this is the Ask Volume  and Bid Volume difference cumulative sum (<a href="indexeb8c.html?page=doc/TechnicalStudiesReference.php#s292">Cumulative Delta Bars - Volume</a>) since the beginning of the chart minus the difference of the Ask Volume  and Bid Volume for the bar being calculated. This calculation does not reset at the start of the trading day. This calculation is not performed for the pullback column.</li>

            <li><b>Cumulative Volume - Day</b>: This displays the accumulated volume at each time period starting at the beginning of each day. Therefore, the first bar of the day will show the total volume for that time period. The next time period will show the sum of the volumes from the first time period and the second time period. The third time period will show the sum of the the accumulated volumes displayed in the second time period added to the volume of the third time period, and so on.</li>

            <li><b>Diagonal Positive Delta Sum</b>: The difference between the Ask Volume at a price level and the Bid Volume at the price level below (diagonal) is calculated. If this difference is positive, then this positive volume difference is  added to the total Diagonal Positive Delta Sum for the bar. This number is always positive. The Ask Volume at the lowest price is added to  the <b>Diagonal Positive Delta Sum</b> since there is no lower Bid Volume to compare it to.</li>

            <li><b>Diagonal Negative Delta Sum</b>: The difference between the Ask Volume at a price level and the Bid Volume at the price level below (diagonal) is calculated. If this difference is  negative, then this  volume difference is  added to the total Diagonal Negative Delta Sum for the bar. This number is always positive. The Bid Volume at the highest price is added to  the <b>Diagonal Negative Delta Sum</b> since there is no  higher Ask Volume to compare it to.</li>

            <li><b>Low Bid Volume Percent</b>: This displays the quotient of the bid volumes at the two lowest price points displayed as a percentage. So, <b>Low Bid Volume Percent</b> = <b>Bid Volume at Second Lowest Price Point</b> / <b>Bid Volume at Lowest Price Point</b> * 100. If there is only a single price point that contains volume data, then the <b>Low Bid Volume Percent</b> will be <b>0</b>.</li>

            <li><b>High Ask Volume Percent</b>: This displays the quotient of the ask volumes at the two highest price points displayed as a percentage. So, <b>High Ask Volume Percent</b> = <b>Ask Volume at Second Highest Price Point</b> / <b>Ask Volume at Highest Price Point</b> * 100. If there is only a single price point that contains volume data, then the <b>High Ask Volume Percent</b> will be <b>0</b>.</li>

        <p>Below are descriptions for each of the Numbers Bars Calculated Values 2 Subgraphs.</p>

        <p>Many of the calculations described below use <a href="#AskVolume">Ask Volume (Ask Trade Volume)</a> and <a href="#BidVolume">Bid Volume (Bid Trade Volume)</a>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Median Ask Volume</b>: This displays the Median Ask Volume across the prices within the bar. When the number of prices is even, the value is the average of the central 2 Ask Volumes.</li>

            <li><b>Median Bid Volume</b>: This displays the Median Bid Volume across the prices within the bar. When the number of prices is even, the value is the average of the central 2 Bid Volumes.</li>

            <li><b>Dominant Ask or Bid Percentage</b>: This displays the dominant side Ask or Bid volume percentage of the total volume.</li>

            <li><b>Average Non-Zero Ask Volume</b>: This displays the average non-zero Ask Volume for the bar. This sums up the non-zero Ask Volumes at each price and then divides by the total number of these Ask Volumes to determine the average.</li>

            <li><b>Average Non-Zero Bid Volume</b>: This displays the average non-zero Bid Volume for the bar. This sums up the non-zero Bid Volumes at each price and then divides by the total number of these Bid Volumes to determine the average.</li>

            <li><b>Ask Volume Bid Volume Difference Per Tick</b>: This displays the difference between the total Ask Volume and the total Bid Volume divided by the range of the data in the bar per tick. 
            <br><br>
            For example, if the Total Ask Volume is 1000 and the Total Bid Volume is 1500 and the data spans prices from 2600.50 to 2602.00 with a Tick Size of 0.25, then the displayed value would be -83.33 ((1000 - 1500) / ((2602.00 - 2600.5) / 0.25)).</li>
            
            <li><b>Sum Bid Pull/Stack</b>: This displays the sum of all of the Bid side  market depth pulling and stacking values.  Only the value  at the very last chart column is updated  for this  Subgraph. At least one of the Pulling/Stacking columns needs to be displayed in the DOM in order to see this subgraph information.</li>
            
            <li><b>Sum Ask Pull/Stack</b>: This displays the sum of all of the Ask side  market depth pulling and stacking values.  Only the value  at the very last chart column is updated  for this  Subgraph. At least one of the Pulling/Stacking columns needs to be displayed in the DOM in order to see this subgraph information.</li>
            
            <li><b>Ask/Bid Pull/Stack Sum Diff</b>: This displays the  <em>difference</em> between   <b>Sum Ask Pull/Stack</b> and  <b>Sum Bid Pull/Stack</b>. Only the value  at the very last chart column is updated  for this  Subgraph. At least one of the Pulling/Stacking columns needs to be displayed in the DOM in order to see this subgraph information.</li>

            <li><b>Volume Above Volume POC</b>: This displays the total volume that is above the Volume Point of Control.</li>

            <li><b>Volume Below Volume POC</b>: This displays the total volume that is below the Volume Point of Control.</li>

            <li><b>Time Since Price Touched Bar High</b>: This displays the amount of time that has elapsed since the last price was at the high of the bar. This value will only be displayed for live data and is not calculated for historical data. Therefore, any recalculation of the chart will remove all previous values that were displayed.</li>

            <li><b>Time Since Price Touched Bar Low</b>: This displays the amount of time that has elapsed since the last price was at the low of the bar. This value will only be displayed for live data and is not calculated for historical data. Therefore, any recalculation of the chart will remove all previous values that were displayed.</li>

            <li><b>Average Ask Volume per Price</b>: This displays the Total Ask Volume divided by the number of prices that make up the bar, less 1 (this can be thought of as the number of ticks that make up the bar).</li>

            <li><b>Average Bid Volume per Price</b>: This displays the Total Bid Volume divided by the number of prices that make up the bar, less 1 (this can be thought of as the number of ticks that make up the bar).</li>

        <p><a href="index9fef.html?page=doc/StudyChartAlertsAndScanning.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Study and Chart Alert Formulas</a> can make reference to the Subgraph values of the Numbers Bars Calculated  Values study.</p>
        
        <p>For any value that is displayed in the Numbers Bars Calculated Values as an Integer (no decimal point) the method to do this is the same as any other study. For example, if you want to reference the <b>Ask Volume Bid Volume Difference (SG1)</b> Subgraph, then use this in the Alert Formula <b>ID#.SG1</b> where # is the study ID number.</p>

        <p>In order to use values that are displayed as a Floating Point number (contains a decimal value), you would have to change the <b>Value Format</b> of the Numbers Bars Calculated Values to be at least as many decimal places as the displayed data. For example, if the value shown is 3875.25, then you would need to set the Value Format to 0.01 (or to a value with more decimal places). You can then access the full number from the subgraph for this data.</p>

        <p>In order to use values that are displayed as a Percentage by default (such as <b>Ask Volume Bid Volume Difference Percent</b>) in an Alert formula, it is first necessary to set the Input for <b>Use Default Number Formatting for All Subgraphs</b> to <b>Yes</b>. When <b>Use Default Number Formatting for All Subgraphs</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>, then the Subgraph can be used in an Alert formula in the same way as other studies. For example, you can reference the Subgraph in an Alert Formula as <b>ID#.SG11</b> where # is the study ID number.</p>

        <p>In order to use values that are displayed as Time by default (such as <b>Bar Duration</b> in an Alert formula, it is first necessary to set the Input for <b>Use Default Number Formatting for All Subgraphs</b> to <b>Yes</b> and also to set the <b>Value Format</b> for the Numbers Bars Calculated Values Study to the maximum precision (0.00000001). This will then display the duration as a <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html#SerialDateTimeValues">serial date/time</a> value which then can be referenced in an alert.</p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#CalculatedValuesBackgroundColoringLogic">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/numbersbarscalculatedvalues-percentageofvaluecoloring.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/numbersbarscalculatedvalues-percentageofvaluecoloring.png" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" alt="" width="540"></a></div>

        <p>When the Numbers Bars Calculated Values Input <b>Color Background Based on Value Percentage</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>, then each cell within the Numbers Bars Calculated Values table will have the background colored according to the following rules. Note that the coloring does not apply to the Labels or the Pullback Column.</p>

        <p>Each row is evaluated on its own. Therefore, there is no comparisons being done between rows of the table. The following explanation will refer to a single row, although the calculations are the same for all rows within the table.</p>

        <p>Within each row, the highest and lowest value can be established from all the data that is present, or it can be done per day or per session. When determining highest and lowest values either per day or per session, all rows are calculated using this method, not only those items that have a Daily or Session reset time. For more information, refer to the Input for <b>Determine Maximum/Minimum Values for Background Coloring From</b>.</p>

        <p>When using Maximum and Minimum values on a daily or per session basis, the calculations described below, which are for all data in the chart, are the same. The only difference is the actual Maximum and Minimum values.</p>

        <p>The last cell/bar in a row will follow the same rules as below, but until the bar is closed, the values that are seen as the cell updates will not be used to establish a Highest or Lowest value. If a value at the last bar exceeds the existing Highest or Lowest value, then that cell is colored the Range 3 Up/Down color, but the rest of the background coloring in the row will not update. Once the last bar closes, if it still establishes a new Highest or Lowest value, then the rest of the cells in the row will be updated accordingly.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>First, the Highest value and the Lowest value are determined for all values in the row (when <b>Determine Maximum/Minimum Values for Background Coloring From</b> is set to <b>All Data</b>) and an Up Range and Down Range are calculated.  The values which are not within the current visible view of the chart are also used.

                <ul>
                    <li>If the Highest value is positive and the Lowest value is negative, then the Up Range is defined from the Highest Value to 0 and the Down Range is defined from the Lowest value to 0 (<b>Up Range</b> = <b>Highest</b> and <b>Down Range</b> = <b>Lowest</b>).</li>

                    <li>If both values are positive, then the Up Range is determined to be the difference between the Highest value and the Lowest value (<b>Up Range</b> = <b>Highest</b> - <b>Lowest</b>).</li>

                    <li>If both values are negative, the the Lower Range is determined to be the difference between the Lowest value and the Highest value (<b>Down Range</b> = <b>Lowest</b> - <b>Highest</b>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li> The Up Range and Down Range are then divided into four percentage groups as defined by the <b>Percent Compare Thresholds</b>. For example, if the Percent Compare Thresholds are set to .25, .50, and .75 then each range is divided into the following groups with each group mapping to a Color Range:

                <ul>
                    <li>0.0% - 24.9% Up/Down Range 0 Color</li>
                    <li>25.0% - 49.9% Up/Down Range 1 Color</li>
                    <li>50.0% - 74.9% Up/Down Range 2 Color</li>
                    <li>75.0% - 100.0% Up/Down Range 3 Color</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>The percentage value of each value in the row is determined and the appropriate coloring selected. Positive values are assigned into the Up Range # Colors and Negative values are assigned into the Down Range # Colors.
                <ul>
                    <li>If the Highest value is positive and the Lowest value is negative, then a cell with a Positive value has its percent value calculated as <b>Percentage</b> = <b>Cell Value</b> / <b>Highest Value</b>; and a cell with a Negative value has its percent value calculated as <b>Percentage</b> = <b>Cell Value</b> / <b>Lowest Value</b>.</li>

                    <li>If the Highest and Lowest values are both Positive, then each cell's percent value is calculated as <b>Percentage<b> = (<b>Cell Value</b> - <b>Lowest Value</b>) / (</b>Highest Value</b> - <b>Lowest Value</b>).</li>

                    <li>If the Highest and Lowest values are both Negative, then each cell's percent value is calculated as <b>Percentage</b> = (<b>Cell Value</b> - <b>Highest Value</b>) / (<b>Lowest Value</b> - <b>Highest Value</b>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Zero values are handled special, depending on the range of values in the row. If the row is all Positive values, then a 0 value is mapped into the Up Range 0 Color. If the row is all Negative values, then a 0 value is mapped into the Down Range 0 Color. If the row values span across zero (both positive and negative values) then a 0 value is mapped into the Up Range 0 Color.</li>

            <li>If a row has all the same values (including all zero values) then the background coloring for all cells in that row uses the Up Range 0 Color.</li>
        </ul>

            <div class="member-link">[<a href="#NumbersBarsCalculatedValuesBackgroundColoringExample2">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

            <p>The following gives an example of the Numbers Bars Calculated Values showing how the last bar in a chart will not affect the background coloring of the rest of the row if the bar happens to be higher or lower than the established high and low. Once the last bar is closed, however, the final value can cause the rest of the bar background colors to change if it establishes a new high or low.</p>

            <p>The following Input values have been changed from the default and are important for this example. In particular, the values that are in the top 95% are displayed with a Light Blue background to make them more obvious.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Color Background Based on Value Percentage</b>: Yes</li>

                <li><b>Percent Compare Thresholds</b>: .25, .50, .95</li>

                <li><b>Range 3 Up Color</b>: Light Blue (R: 128, G: 255, B:255)</li>

                <li><b>Subgraph Displayed</b>: Bid Volume Percent</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The image below shows the highest value in the row is at the second bar in from the left at a time of 16:15 with a value of 56.83% and has a background of Light Blue. The rest of the colors are shaded based on this established highest value.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/numbersbarscalculatedvalueslastbarcoloringexample2-before.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/numbersbarscalculatedvalueslastbarcoloringexample2-before.png" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" alt=""></a></div>

            <p>The image below shows the last bar at a time of 04:15 has now exceeded the previously established high of 56.83% with a new high value of 66.67%, therefore the last bar is also colored Light Blue. The rest of the bars, however, have not changed their coloring, as the last bar has not closed yet, and this highest value may not be the same value that is established when the bar closes. Therefore, we do not use this temporary value as a new high.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/numbersbarscalculatedvalueslastbarcoloringexample2-during.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/numbersbarscalculatedvalueslastbarcoloringexample2-during.png" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" alt=""></a></div>

            <p>The image below shows the bar at 4:15 has now closed and another bar is starting to its right. The bar at 4:15 did not close with a value that is greater than the already established high value and did not close with a value that is less than the already established low value. This bar, therefore, has a background coloring of Green, and the rest of the bars have not changed their background colors.</p>

        <p>It is supported to display more than one <b>Numbers Bars Calculated  Values</b> study on a chart.</p>

        <p>The reason why you would want to do this is when you want to specify different  <a href="#VolumeFiltering">Volume Filtering</a> settings for the <b>Numbers Bars Calculated Values</b> study compared to the Volume Filtering settings on the Destination chart it is applied to. This is done by having the <b>Numbers Bars Calculated Values</b> study refer to another chart with different Volume Filtering settings.</p>

        <p>Another reason would be you want to add another <b>Numbers Bars Calculated Values</b> study to a chart is to have it refer to a chart for a different symbol.</p>

        <p>Follow the instructions below to add a <b>Numbers Bars Calculated Values</b> study that references another chart.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Open another Intraday chart through <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Find Symbol</b>. This chart is called the <em>Source</em> chart.</li>

            <li>For this Source Intraday chart, set the <a href="#VolumeFiltering">Volume Filtering</a> for it as required. Make sure that <b>Filter Trade Completely</b> is <em>unchecked</em> on the Source chart. This must be <em>unchecked</em>.</li>

            <li>Add to the Source chart the <b>Numbers Bars Calculated Values</b> study. For instructions refer to the <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#AddingModifyingStudies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adding/Modifying</a> studies section. This is necessary for the Source chart to maintain the necessary data arrays which are relied upon by the Destination chart. The default configuration for this study is acceptable. This study can be kept hidden.</li>

            <li> Go to the Destination chart where you want to add the <b>Numbers Bars Calculated Values</b> study. This is <em>not</em> the chart opened in Step 1.</li>
