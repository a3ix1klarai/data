    <h2>Log of Changes and Improvements to Sierra Chart</h2>
    
    <p>This list contains major items of development, items which are notable, and changes and additions which users need to be informed about.</p>
    
    <p>This is not a comprehensive changes and additions log. It only represents <em>less than 25% of the actual development</em>  performed every day. There are <em>not</em> version notes for each version. The main Sierra Chart documentation is updated as needed relating to the changes and additions.</p>

    <p>In addition to the below listed items for each version, there are also various low-level improvements, issues resolved, and small additions that a release has which are not listed.</p>

    <ul class="NewListing">
        <li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2516>2516 Release Date: 2023-06-27</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2516">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
        
        
    <li> There has been an issue reported from time to time mainly among users using Sierra Chart on Wine. This is when adding accounts to the Order Allocation to Trade Accounts interface, that Sierra Chart abnormally shuts down.  We always have believed that this looks like a problem in Sierra Chart but we just could not find it.  We had reviewed  the code more than once and we could not identify the issue.  However, once we were able to reproduce the issue, it then became clear where the problem was. It was deeper in the code then than we had looked previously.  This problem is now resolved  in this version.</li>
    
    <li>Improvements to the Chart Studies window. It is now possible to "Load" Study Collections directly from that window.  When you load a Study Collection it will be applied to the chart immediately.   The window  has also been reorganized so that the  <b>Studies to Graph</b> list is larger.</li>
  
    
    </ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2504>2504 Release Date: 2023-05-18</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2504">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
        
        
    <li> Improvements with the Spread Order Entry study:  1. Identified a problem where the order quantities after triggering that are displayed in the Chart Region where the study is, were just showing a zeros. This is resolved.  2. There was no price multiplier applied in the case of Trading services which use a multiplier other than 1 for market orders for symbols different than the chart, but that did not affect order fills in any way. This was just a display issue in the Trade Orders window. This is fixed. 3.   We added what price the spread was at when the study triggered, to the on chart display. </li>
    
    <li> Added support for real-time and delayed data  for the new US   Equities Consolidated Tape data feeds.  Added support for delayed  data for the NASDAQ Global Indexes data feed.</li>
 
 

   <li>With the Order Allocation to Trade accounts functionality, when performing a Flatten operation  from a chart set to a particular Symbol and Trade Account,  that Flatten operation will be copied to the other Trade Accounts for the same symbol and there will be a re-determination as to what the  Position quantity is for that   other  Symbol and Trade Account. Rather than  copying the identical order from the controlling chart, the appropriate quantity to Flatten the Position will be used for the Position, if any,  for the symbol in the other Trade Accounts. </li>
  
    
    </ul>

    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2494>2494 Release Date: 2023-04-21</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2494">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
        
        
    <li> The following ACSIL member variables are no longer supported: sc.ChartBackgroundColor, sc.UseGlobalChartColors,  sc.ScaleBorderColor. They have been replaced with the following ACSIL functions: sc.GetGraphicsSetting(), sc.SetGraphicsSetting(), sc.SetUseGlobalGraphicsSettings().  These new functions provide a full comprehensive access to all color and graphic settings of the chart. Documentation will be added for these new functions as soon as possible.</li>

    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2492>2492 Release Date: 2023-04-11</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2492">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
        
        
    <li>Added support for the new NASDAQ Global Indexes data feed and the new United States Equities Consolidated Tape data feed.</li>
    
    <li> Corrected issue with modifying trade order price through the modify order window that use fractional values.  Previously, the fractional price was not included in the modification. This is now resolved.</li>
    
    <li> Added new chart shortcut menu command for starting a replay from the point in the chart that you right-click at with your Pointer to  display the chart shortcut menu. </li>
   
    <li> New ACSIL functions for getting and setting colors, line widths, and line styles, for charts graphics.  </li>
   
    <li>Removed support for Trading Technologies order routing. </li>
   
    <li>Added new  Blank Volume Profile style for the Volume by Price  study to prevent the drawing of the Volume Profile itself. You can use this in case where you want to have the extension lines but not the volume profile itself.</li>

        <h3 id=SCVer2480>2480 Release Date: 2023-02-07</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2480">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>   
        
        
    <li>Updated the interface to  Interactive Brokers TWS to resolve compatibility issues.  The updates done in 2474 were incomplete and there were numerous other changes required.  In version 2474 through 2479, there   was essentially broken compatibility with TWS  due to breaking changes by Interactive Brokers. At this point we do not expect there to be further compatibility issues with  Interactive Brokers TWS with version 2480  and higher.

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2478">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>   
        
        
    <li>Added  new Control Bar  buttons to select order types.</li>
    
    <li>Add a new setting the Chart Settings to include or exclude a chart from the Trade Statistics for Charts tab on the Trade Activity Log.</li>

        <li>Corrected a problem, from version 2433 related to the synchronization of the  Internal  Trade Position Quantity to the Service   Position Quantity. There was a scenario discovered, where the synchronization would not take place.  This would affect mainly Teton order routing   and the Trading Evaluator services.

        <li>Fixed a problem with the Zig Zag study Input for <b>Color ZigZag Line Using</b> where selecting <b>None</b> will now revert the color back to the original Zig Zag line color.</li>
    
        <li>Corrected a problem  with the  synchronization  of the Internal  Trade Position Quantity to the Service   Position Quantity. There are uncommon cases where this could  occur to soon leading to an  incorrect Internal Position quantity for a period of  about 8 seconds.  Additionally the delay before synchronization has been reduced down to 5 seconds from 8 seconds. And when Sierra Chart connects to a  Trading service it now will request the  Positions and Orders in a 1/4 of a second instead of 3 seconds. Previously it was about 5 seconds because  there were some services we worked with that would not give  Order and Position data so quickly.  Sierra Chart does not work with those kinds of services anymore.</li>

      CME Group and EUREX  <em>market data</em> is no longer supported through CQG. Users must use the <a href = "index2530.html?page=doc/DenaliExchangeDataFeed.php">Denali Exchange Data Feed</a> for market data.      
      <br> <br>
       This change only applies to market data and  <em>not trading</em>. You can still trade CME Group and EUREX through CQG when using Sierra Chart.
      <br> <br>
      We recommend that users move from CQG to  <a href = "index35f0.html?page=doc/SierraChartDirectOrderRoutingService.php">Teton Order Routing Service</a>  if you are trading the CME Group. Teton is superior  in every way and has no transaction fees.
      <br> <br>
      One exception   to the above is  futures options and  exchange traded  futures spreads market data from CQG for CME Group and EUREX are still supported. In the case of options and spreads, you can optionally use the Denali Exchange Data Feed for this market data and still trade CQG options and spreads  by using the  <b>Trade and Current Quote  Symbol</b> Chart Setting. For options, refer to  <a href = "index2530.html?page=doc/DenaliExchangeDataFeed.php#UsingDenaliFuturesOptionsDataWithTradingService">Using Denali Futures Options Data with Trading Service</a>.
        <br> <br>
      Once you begin to use the Denali Exchange Data Feed  you will definitely want to cancel market data exchange fees that you pay through your broker.  Request your broker to cancel those fees. If they will not cancel them, let us know what broker that is so we can discuss it with them  and come to a solution for this case.  Until you are able to use the Denali Exchange Data Feed, stay on a version prior to 2394 if you are using CQG  market data for CME Group or EUREX.

    <li> Various enhancements to the new Chart Settings window.</li>
    <li> There are new settings in <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Settings &gt;&gt; Settings Windows</b>, to control the behavior of interacting with settings in the new Settings Windows so that only a single left click is required to perform an edit operation  of the setting.  Additionally, buttons  in these new Settings Windows are now by default colored with a gray background   and a black foreground for the text.</li>

    <li>Important technical notice: It is come to our attention, that a problem has developed  with versions released since February 14, 2022  with the  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Trade Settings &gt;&gt; Send Order Fills to SC Web Server</b> option.  
    <br> <br>
    This option is for specialized purposes only and most users do not have it enabled. And you should not have it enabled any longer.

    <br> <br>
    We are requesting Sierra Chart users to disable this option. Exit from Sierra Chart and go into the /TradeActivityLogs subfolder in your Sierra Chart installation folder and if you see a  <em>OrderFillsToSend.data</em> file, then delete it. This may actually be a large file.   Rather than going through this procedure you can also just update Sierra Chart to this version or higher. Update with   <b class="menu_item">Help   &gt;&gt; Download Current Version.</b>
    <br> <br>
    What we discovered has happened, is that the uploading of fills is no longer  working since versions released since February 14,  up until this version,  and the size of this file would get larger and larger for two different reasons. One reason is that the fills are not being sent, and the other reason is that the file is not getting cleared when it is being rewritten when Sierra Chart exits.

    <br> <br>
    This large file causes two problems. It causes high CPU usage when Sierra Chart is starting and when exiting and can cause a delay with exiting and also causes a large amount of memory use.  You would <em>not be affected by this problem</em> if order fills are not being uploaded to the server  and this file does not exist, or is not a large file.
    <br> <br>
    We are requesting all users to upgrade to this version or higher  as soon as possible.  After the update, exit from Sierra Chart to cause this large file to be deleted.
    <br> <br>
    We also must emphasize overwhelmingly very clearly, that this issue affects a small number of users and if you have a high memory usage or high CPU usage problem, then most likely it is not related to this issue. High CPU and memory usage issues in almost all cases are  <em>unrelated</em> to this issue.

    <li> Various enhancements related to Teton order  routing service.  For example, when using the Flatten button on the Trade Positions Window a flatten command is sent to the server  rather than a market order and using the quantity calculated on the client side. </li>
    
   <li> Requested ACSIL functions have been added. Refer to the end of the /ACS_Source/SierraChart.h header file provided with Sierra Chart, for the new functions added  and the parameters that they require.</li>
    
    <li> Resolved exception issue with TPO Profile Charts that occurs under some conditions:

    <li> Removed support for the CTS Trading Platform Service.  From the perspective of Sierra Chart, this is considered a legacy service.  Support for this service will still be maintained in older versions of Sierra Chart.  If you are trading the CME Group of exchanges, you need to use the <a href = "index35f0.html?page=doc/SierraChartDirectOrderRoutingService.php">Teton Order Routing Service</a> which replaces CTS and other services.

This only applies when you are using real-time and historical data <em>direct from CQG</em>, and not from the  <a href = "index2530.html?page=doc/DenaliExchangeDataFeed.php">Denali Exchange Data Feed</a> provided by Sierra Chart.  This does not affect Denali Exchange Data Feed users.

     If you require historical tick by tick data, you must use the <a href = "index2530.html?page=doc/DenaliExchangeDataFeed.php">Denali Exchange Data Feed</a> when using CQG. Understand, when CQG support was added by Sierra Chart there was not the intention to add market data support. We do not want to support CQG data. It creates a poor impression for Sierra Chart for numerous reasons and we do not want to answer any technical questions about CQG data. We are our own data provider.  CQG historical data is hugely inferior to what Sierra Chart provides.  Sierra Chart provides 10+ years  of historical tick by tick and daily  data delivered fast and efficiently and processed on a background thread. Whereas with CQG you get data for current contracts only.
      <br> <br>

    We are phasing it out to the extent possible. If you require proper data for Sierra Chart, you must use the <a href = "index2530.html?page=doc/DenaliExchangeDataFeed.php">Denali Exchange Data Feed</a>.  You only  need to pay for the   <em>exchange fees once</em>.  When you pay them  through the Denali Exchange Data Feed, you then cancel them through your broker. You will also cancel historical market data access from your broker for CQG.
     <br> <br>
    One of the reasons, that historical tick by tick data  was always limited by Sierra Chart when accessing it from CQG, is that it is processed on the primary  thread of Sierra Chart,   unlike data from Sierra Chart provided historical data services which is a background thread, and it is provided in time reversed order  from CQG.  Downloading  of this historical chart data   causes the user interface of Sierra Chart to freeze  and there is excessive memory use. It is also slow to download from CQG.
     <br> <br>

    And for the lowest cost and highest quality and most advanced, futures order routing you need to use the  <a href = "index35f0.html?page=doc/SierraChartDirectOrderRoutingService.php">Teton Order Routing Service</a> instead of CQG. Depending upon the amount of trading you do, you can save   <em>substantially</em> (.00 USD (Teton) per contract versus .10 USD (CQG) per contract), and have superior order routing as compared to CQG.  You also eliminate the monthly connection fee to CQG that CQG charges.
    <br> <br>
    Until you use the Denali Exchange Data Feed, you can go back to a   <a href = "indexc97d.html?page=doc/SoftwareDownload.php#Rollback">prior version</a> of Sierra Chart. You will need to re-download the historical data to obtain tick by tick data for up to  5 days.
     <br> <br>
    Effective by April 2022,  for new users and for usage time renewals, Service Package 10, 11, or 12  will be required to use CQG.

        <ul> 
  
    <li> Resolved issues with new implementation of <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Settings</b> window. </li>
    
    
    <li> Chart/Trade DOM performance improvements.   These will be especially noticeable when there are more than 10 levels of market depth levels displayed.  The more levels, the greater performance improvement.  Further performance improvements will be made in the next two weeks.</li>
    
    <li>  Resolved a problem where, the Quantity value in the  <b class="menu_item">Trade  &gt;&gt; Trade Positions Window</b>  may not synchronize to the Service Position Quantity field  also in this window.  This is not a common issue. It is important  to update as soon as possible.</li>

        <ul> 
  
    <li> Changes to how back adjustments are done for continuous futures contract charts. The prior day settlement  prices  are now used rather than the current day open prices. </li>
    
    
    <li>Added new Input for Numbers Bars study called <b>Color Non-Dominant Ask/Bid Text Same as Opposing Side</b>. When set to <b>Yes</b> this Input will force the coloring of the non-dominant Ask/Bid at the same price level that would typically be drawn in the Default Text Color, to be drawn using the same color as the opposing sides color. This does not color diagonally, even for diagonal comparisons.</li>

        <ul> 
 
 <li> Resolved a problem affecting version 2342 and 2343, where when opening a file for overwrite mode, the file may not have been truncated and may have contained  at the end of the file some left over data from the prior state of the file. This left over data at most would cause an error when the file  is opened and successfully read.  Another condition would be a file may not have been cleared when it should have been.  This could for example cause the orders list to show the prior state of orders.   This primarily affected, the orders list file, positions list file, and trade activity files.  These versions have been locked out.</li>
