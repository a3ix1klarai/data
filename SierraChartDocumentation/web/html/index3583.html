    <h2>Log of Changes and Improvements to Sierra Chart</h2>
    
    <p>This list contains major items of development, items which are notable, and changes and additions which users need to be informed about.</p>
    
    <p>This is not a comprehensive changes and additions log. It only represents <em>less than 25% of the actual development</em>  performed every day. There are <em>not</em> version notes for each version. The main Sierra Chart documentation is updated as needed relating to the changes and additions.</p>

    <p>In addition to the below listed items for each version, there are also various low-level improvements, issues resolved, and small additions that a release has which are not listed.</p>

    <ul class="NewListing">
        <li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1684>1684 Release Date: 2018-01-08</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1684">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li>Additional work on the <b>Add Additional Symbol </b> study. Various improvements have been made and corrected a problem with this study which would cause Sierra_Chart to freeze after a period of time  and would require a forced shutdown to recover from this condition. Internally what was happening was a deadlock condition related to mishandling of synchronization locks related to background writing of Intraday file data. If using this study,  it is essential to use this version or higher.</li>

    <li>Fixed an issue with Renko bars related to the filling of gaps at the first trade of the day.   New  <b>Renko New Bar Modes</b> added.</li>
    
    <li>When connected to an external trading service which does not use the DTC protocol, when a bracket order is received from a sub instance,  the child orders of the bracket order sent out to the external trading service, if supported,  now have the proper quantity instead of 0.</li>

    <li>Associated Watch List new features: New  menu command to set charts in Chartbook to symbols in watch list. When setting charts to the symbols of the watch list, there is now a prompt to automatically open additional charts as needed.</li>

    <li>Corrected problem where sometimes chart tabs would not move when dragging them.</li>

    <li>Added support for dragging Chartbook tabs to be able to reorder them.</li>

    <li>Additional improvements to the Study Summary window feature.</li>
</li>
</ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1678>1678 Release Date: 2017-12-29</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1678">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li> The data structure used by the new ACSIL function <b>sc.GetBarPeriodParameters()</b> which was released in 1677 has been changed. It is essential to recompile when using this version or higher to avoid a stack corruption, if you are using this function. A corresponding <b>sc.SetBarPeriodParameters()</b> is being added to the next release. Between these two functions, there is now in an easy to use unified way to get the bar period parameters  and set the bar period parameters rather than the various other variables like sc.SecondsPerBar.</li>
    
    <li> Corrected a problem which arose  in the prior release with the <b>Add Additional Symbol</b> study where chart bars for that study during a replay or real-time updating,  were incomplete or did not contain any data. The <b>Add Additional Symbol</b> study  now supports all of the replay back testing modes. Although at this time Bar Based Back testing is not supported with the <b>Add Additional Symbol</b> study. It will be in the next release.</li>
</ul>
    </section>

    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1677>1677 Release Date: 2017-12-27</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1677">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li>Added ACSIL member sc.IsChartbookBeingSaved to indicate when Chartbook is being saved. Study functions are now called when Chartbook is being saved so a study can perform whatever actions it needs to.</li>
    <li> Added new ACSIL members:  ConstantRangeScaleModeTicksFromCenterOrEdge,  GetBarPeriodParameters(n_ACSIL::s_BarPeriod& r_BarPeriod). </li>
    
    <li>Completed development of the  <b> Add Additional  Symbol </b> study.</li>
    <li>Additional enhancements to the Study Summary window.</li>
    <li> Improved the management of  Attached Order offsets for bracket orders that originate through the DTC Protocol Server. </li>
    
    <li> Improved  Spreadsheet  saving and loading performance. This will be similar to as it was before the changes to reduce memory use  when  saving and loading Spreadsheets. </li>
    
    <li> Corrected some issues with exporting of study data when using  <b class = "menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Export Bar and Study Data to Text File </b> or when using the <b>Write Bar and Study Data to File </b> study. </li>
</ul>
    </section>

        <h3 id=SCVer1674>1674 Release Date: 2017-12-22</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1674">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li> New Numbers Bars Background Coloring Method and Text Coloring Method named <b>Based On Separate Diagonal AskVol BidVol Percentage</b>. When using this new coloring along with a display that shows both the Bid and Ask sides, the coloring will always be present for both the Bid and Ask sides regardless of which side is dominant. When displaying a single item, the coloring is chosen based on the dominant side. The comparison is done using a Diagonal Percentage of Ask/Bid or Bid/Ask Volume.</li>
    
    <li>The move to breakeven price for Stop Attached Orders now adjusts for Scaling In to use a weighted average. </li>
    <li>Study Summary window now supports all of the available Quote Board fields.</li>
    <li>Corrected a problem with the loading of chart data which occurred in a recent release that some users were experiencing where the load would not either complete, or it would occur on the primary thread causing Sierra_Chart to freeze during the loading process.  In most cases there was not a problem but it could occur under some conditions.</li>
    <li>Nearly completed the development of the new <b>Add Additional Symbol</b> study which loads chart data for an additional symbol into the chart. </li>
    <li>Various other low-level development.</li>
</ul>

        <ul>
    <li>When opening and saving spreadsheet files,  this is done using a new streaming format  where a minimum amount of memory is used.</li>
    <li>In version 1662, the new underlying file  format for spreadsheets was released.  Any spreadsheet saved with this version or higher cannot be used by an older Sierra Chart version. However, there are backups of spreadsheets available.</li>
    <li>With the LMAX trading service, symbols from the SC Exchange Data Feed can now be used. These will be added on request as needed.</li>

    <li>New ACSIL members: CalculateAngle(), NumberOfForwardColumns, AllocateAndNameRenkoChartBarArrays, OpenChartbook(), IsDateTimeInEveningSession()
    </li>
    <li>Added new Study Summary window for Chartbook. This is opened through <b class = "menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Open Study Summary Window</b>. This feature is still under development.</li>
    
    <li>Changes to Renko bars. The <b>Renko New Bar Mode </b> option for a new reversal bar to reference the prior close always, has been reimplemented to be "New Reversal Bar When Reversal Amount Met Plus 1 Tick".  This corrects a problem with the previous setting, where it did not function properly in most cases and produced incorrect Renko bar charts.  It functioned properly only in one isolated test case that it was tested against.   The current implementation is a more proper and logical implementation according to the objectives we understand from those who need this and we expect should match Universal Renko bars  in another popular implementation used by another program.</li>
    <li>Additional options to control the formation of Renko bars has been added to <b class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b> <b> &gt;&gt; Intraday Chart Bar Period</b>. There are a total of nine options giving you a greater degree of control. </li>

    <li>Universal Renko Bars have been renamed to <b>Flex Renko Inverse Setting Bars</b> since they use inverse settings compared to Flex Renko bars. Also, Flex Renko Inverse Setting Bars no longer require a reversal to be one tick more than the  <b>Reversal  Bar Trigger</b> amount. The reversal amount is simply the amount of <b>Reversal Bar Trigger</b>.</li>

    <li>The parameters and implementation of the ACSIL functions  <b>sc.RelayNewSymbol</b> and  <b>sc.RelayTradeUpdate </b> have changed. If  your custom study is using these functions,  it must be updated to the current  function specifications and recompiled. Otherwise, there will be instability and malfunctions.   The ACSIL function sc.CreateRelayServer has been removed. Refer to the  <a href="indexb9b8.html?page=doc/ACSIL_Members_Functions.html" >ACSIL Functions</a>  page for details.</li>
    
    <li>Changes to ACSIL <b>sc.GetStudyPeakValleyLine</b> function. Any custom study using this function must be recompiled.  Refer to the  <a href="indexb9b8.html?page=doc/ACSIL_Members_Functions.html" >ACSIL Functions</a>  page for details.</li>
    
    <li>Ability to set Subgraph line Name and Value Labels to a different color than the subgraph itself.  The new settings are in the  <b>Study Settings </b> window.</li>
    
    <li>Additional options to control the formation of Renko bars has been added to  <b class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b> <b>  &gt;&gt; Intraday Chart  Bar Period</b>. There are a total of six options giving you full control. This is especially  useful when  using the Numbers Bars  study on a Renko bar chart.</li>
    
    <li>New option on Trade Window menu (Menu/M) to cancel orders when the Trade Position Quantity goes from nonzero back to zero. The command is  <b class = "menu_item">Menu/M &gt;&gt; Orders &gt;&gt; Cancel Orders on Flat Position</b>.</li>
    
    <li>Added the ability for ACSIL studies  to create custom chart bars very efficiently. Refer to the  <b>/ACS_Source/ACSILCustomChartBars_Example.cpp </b> file for an example.</li>
    
    <li>Upcoming: Added  <b>Ask Bid Difference</b> optional field to the Chart Header.</li>
   

    <li>   A change to the Numbers Bars  study when using the Text  Coloring Method  <b>Based on Diagonal Dominant AskVol BidVol Percentage</b>. Previously, it was not coloring the text sides based on whether they were dominant, it was just coloring both sides at all times, except when there was a comparison to 0. This was inconsistent with both the name of this   text coloring method and the other Diagonal Dominant coloring options. The change now makes this consistent with the other options, where now each side will only be colored if it is diagonally dominant. Refer to the updated   <a href="index5ee6.html?page=doc/NumbersBars.php#TextColoringBasedOnDiagonalDominantSideAskVolBidVolPercentage" >Based on Diagonal Dominant AskVol BidVol Percentage</a> documentation. </li>

    <li> All of the   <b>Renko Bar  </b>  <b>Bar Period Types  </b> have been rewritten.  All four types now use a common code base.  The Renko  <b>Graph Draw Types</b> have been removed because   they were determined to be no longer necessary. The  standard   <b>Candlestick </b>  Graph Draw Type is now used instead and functions like a Renko bar for the Renko  Bar Period Types. We now later realize that this has the disadvantage of preventing a visual display of the true open and close values. We can restore  these separate  <b>Renko</b> Graph Draw Types if needed.
    <br> <br>
    
    When using the   <b>Bar Period Type &gt;&gt; Renko  Bar</b>, there is no longer any alignment  of the first  Renko bar Open to the Box Size. Instead the alignment is based upon   the true Open price for the trading day when   <b>New Bar  at Session Start </b> is enabled in the   <b class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b>. For alignment, use the   <b>Bar Period Type &gt;&gt; Aligned Renko Bar</b> instead.
    <br> <br>
     Also, by default   price gaps are not filled with Renko bars unless using one of the   <b>Gap Fill </b> options   in  <b class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings </b> <b> &gt;&gt; Intraday Chart Bar Periods</b>. 
    </li>
    
    <li> The old  <b>Renko  Chart </b> and  <b>Renko Chart  Enhanced  </b> studies are no longer in the main study  list and can only be added through  <b class = "menu_item">Analysis &gt;&gt; Studies &gt;&gt; Add Custom Study</b>. </li>

    <li> Improvements to importing data, to allow the import of data for a symbol which currently has a chart opened for it.</li>
    <li> Additional improvements to the Intraday Data File Management functionality. </li>
    <li> <b>Percent  Change Since Open </b> and  <b>Percent   Change Since Previous Close  </b> now use the   <b>Percent </b> Value Format.  </li>
    
    <li>Various other less significant development. As we have reported before,  the What is New page only reports about 25% of actual development.</li>
    
    <li> Working on direct integration to BitMEX.  The BitMEX data feed now uses our own code rather than an intermediary software program  which BitMEX was using. </li>

    <li>  It is believed the issue that some users experienced with freezing of Sierra_Chart when starting a replay  with <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b>, has been resolved. If there is any further issue with this, let us know.   We have consistently been unable to reproduce this issue and could find no cause as of yet after extensive code review.   Some  changes have been made and additional code review will be done.</li>

    <li> Various  small  improvements and issues resolved with  Drawing Tools and documentation updates on the Chart Drawing Tools  documentation page. </li>

    <li> Added  <b>Last Trade Price Box Outline</b> color setting  in the Graphics Settings window.  </li>

    <li> Various other development.</li>

        <ul>
    <li>Interactive Brokers delayed streaming data support.</li>
    
    <li>New background color settings for  Chart/Trade DOM market data columns Cumulative Last Size, Last Size,  and Last Price Background Bid/Ask Trade.  </li>
   
    <li> Corrected issue with keyboard  shortcuts being nonfunctional arising  in one revision of 1592. </li>
    
    <li> Now when the Chart DOM is not enabled,  the text and background  color settings  in Graphics Settings for the last trade price box, based on bid and ask trades, is now functional.  These   color settings require setting the  <b>Enabled </b> option for these color settings to be applied.</li>
 
     <li>Using common code for all extension lines so that all  study Subgraph   settings/properties for the extension lines apply to extension lines for Volume Profiles and TPO Profiles, consistently and fully. Internal performance improvements with the Volume by Price study.  This development is still in progress.</li>
 
 
     <li>Added new  <b Class = "menu_item">Tools &gt;&gt; More Tools &gt;&gt; Log Drawing Statistics</b> command to log drawing related  performance statistics into the Message Log. </li>
 
      <li>Corrected issue  with  using the Good till Date-Time setting on the Trade Window, which arose in a recent release.  When using the CQG Web API service, the good till date-time is now adjusted to UTC before sending to CQG , as is required. </li>
 
     <li>There are now 150 Advanced Custom Study Buttons compared with 50.  Due to the necessary implementation  and for safety reasons, it was not possible to maintain the  assigned keyboard shortcuts for the first 50 if they were assigned.  Those will be cleared upon an update to   version 1594 or higher, and will need to be reset as required. </li>

    <li>In ACSIL, <b>SC_ACS_TOOL#</b> identifiers have been renamed to <b>ACS_BUTTON_#</b>.</li>

        <ul>
    <li>Corrected  an issue from a recent release with the Intraday data editor  where the chart would not reload after changes  to data records   when the editor window is closed.</li>
    <li>  With the Numbers Bar study, when  <b>Enable   Diagonal  Zero Bid/Ask Compares</b>, Input is set to  No, then   when comparing to a nonexistent price level, the resulting percentage will be 0 and/or  there will be no color drawn.  May general improvements to the   <b>Based on AskVol BidVol Diagonal Difference Percentage of Bar Range   </b>  Text/Background Coloring Method.   Fully updated the Numbers   Bars documentation to document in detail, each Background and Text coloring method.</li>

        <ul>
    <li>Added option on the Trade   menu for enabling automated trading for individual charts. The default is enabled.</li>
    
    <li>  Added option in <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings   &gt;&gt; General Settings </b>   to set the  start of the week to Monday instead of Sunday. We realize, that only the United States and Canada recognize Sunday as the beginning of the week. The international standard is Monday.</li>
    
    <li> All of the time related Spreadsheet functions now support milliseconds.  The documentation has been updated. </li>
    <li>Corrected long-standing problem with the   <b>Study/Price Overlay  </b> Study when another study is based on it where it would not update its output arrays immediately for new bars added but do that the next calculation. An example of where this would be   a problem is when a study  like the   <b>Study Subgraph   Multiply </b> study is based on the Study/Price Overlay study.  When a new bar  is added to the chart, the overlay study  updating   was being delayed until the next time the study is calculated. This was  due to an incorrect   determination of the array size because of the allocated dependent Date-Time array  for the study.   In the past the resolution to this issue was to select  <b class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Recalculate</b>.   This is no longer necessary.</li>
    
    <li>Updated all of the arithmetic studies to perform calculations  at earlier indexes when they are based on the   <b>Study/Price Overlay</b> study and also update a special index to indicate where they were updated when the   <b>Study/Price Overlay  </b> study   is based on them or other studies.</li>
    
    <li>In the case of the LMAX Trading service, when new  historical order fills  are received from the remote trading server, the connected Sierra_Chart clients are automatically notified of this and request the fills.  </li>

        <ul>
    <li>When adjusting a Chart Drawing from ACSIL, if more than one   Chart Drawing uses the same   LineNumber, only the first found drawing will be  adjusted for performance reasons. Therefore, it is not considered   best practice to use the  same <b>LineNumber </b>  for different Chart Drawings added by the   ACSIL <b>sc.UseTool</b> function.</li>
    
    <li>With the Numbers Bars study there is a new Input to highlight and extend nonzero bid volume and ask volume at the high and low of a Numbers Bar. The extension is until  intersection with future prices.</li>
    
    <li>The Volume by Price study has a new input to extend the Volume Weighted Average Price  line.</li>
    
    <li>Corrected an issue with processing the trade quantity/volume for certain exchanges  with the Tele Trader data service.</li>
    
    <li>Various drawing tool improvements.</li>
    
    <li>Combining  of CME trades into the larger original   summary trade with the Sierra_Chart Exchange Data Feed.   This feature is under development still.</li>
    
    <li>Automatic downloading of historical Intraday data for open charts that are not receiving real-time data when using the <b> SC Data - All Services</b> service.</li>
    
    <li>Support  for  AMP Clearing when using CTS.</li>
    
    <li>For  Continuous  Futures Contract charts  back adjustment changes  are now modified through   <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Symbol Settings</b>.</li>
    
    <li> Added new sc.BaseDataEndDateTime array to ACSIL which contains the ending date time for each chart bar. This requires setting  sc.MaintainAdditionalChartDataArrays to 1 to cause this data to be maintained.</li>
   
   <li> When using the TransAct Trading service, when there is an order rejection for a new order,   in particular an order where a Good Till Canceled Time in Force is not supported,  the order rejection was not mapped to the correct order.  This leads to a case where the order looks like it is nonresponsive. Instead there was a new order being added to the order list. This problem has been resolved.  The underlying problem is that when the TransAct bridge program  rejects this type of order, it sets the Trade Account to "0" instead of the actual trade account   which causes this problem because it looks like the order is for a different account. </li>

        <ul>
    <li><b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Global Profit/Loss Management</b> now includes a new option to lock trading for the entire day  rather than a specified number of minutes. This is useful for automated trading once a certain profit or loss target has been met, to prevent further  order submission.</li> 
    
  
    <li>The Numbers Bar study now supports extending the Point of Control for a Numbers Bar until future intersection. This is set through the  <b>Highlight  Point of Control  In</b> Input.    A separate color setting will be added including support for a price label.</li>
  
    <li>There is now a much more simplified method to change the contract rollover amount/difference  for back adjusted Continuous Futures Contract charts. Refer to <a href="index5c14.html?page=doc/ContinuousFuturesContractCharts.html#ControllingRolloverAmount">Controlling Rollover Amount for Back Adjustments</a>.</li>
