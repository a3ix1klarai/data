    <h2>Log of Changes and Improvements to Sierra Chart</h2>
    
    <p>This list contains major items of development, items which are notable, and changes and additions which users need to be informed about.</p>
    
    <p>This is not a comprehensive changes and additions log. It only represents <em>less than 25% of the actual development</em>  performed every day. There are <em>not</em> version notes for each version. The main Sierra Chart documentation is updated as needed relating to the changes and additions.</p>

    <p>In addition to the below listed items for each version, there are also various low-level improvements, issues resolved, and small additions that a release has which are not listed.</p>

    <ul class="NewListing">
        <li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2031>2031 Release Date: 2019-12-30</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2031">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
     
      <li>Improved the conversion to a common currency ( <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Trade Settings &gt;&gt;  Common Profit/Loss Currency</b>) so that it is able to convert to more currencies  from particular source currencies by using an intermediate currency. </li>
      
      <li> Totals   for market depth pulling and stacking  market data columns are displayed. </li>
      
      <li> The number of decimal places when a profit/loss values displayed as a currency can now be controlled and is in <b class="menu_item"> Global Settings &gt;&gt; Global Trade Settings</b>. </li>
      
      <li> Trade activity data is now stored in files which include the trade account.  This improves  query performance. Other query optimizations have been made as well. </li>
       
      <li>Added  <b>Volume by Price Reset Button</b> study. Documentation will be added as soon as possible but this will  reset the selected Volume by Price study  to start its Volume Profile at the current Date-Time, when the selected Custom Study Button is  selected on the Control Bar. </li>
       
       <li>Added  the MESA Adaptive Moving Average study.</li>
       
       <li>Enabling <b>Hide Values Scale</b> in the Chart Settings will no longer hide the Left Hand Values Scale if it is also displayed. To remove the display of both scales, it is necessary to also deselect the option for <b>Use Left Side Scale</b>.</li>
    
    </ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2028>2028 Release Date: 2019-12-16</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2028">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul> 
    
    <li> Removed the automatic translation of symbols  to the current service when opening a Chartbook.  It was removed because it can cause some unexpected behaviors. </li>
    
     </ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2027>2027 Release Date: 2019-12-13</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2027">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>    
     
    <li>The function signature for ACSIL function sc.FormatVolumeValue has been changed. A Boolean type was changed to an  Integer type to avoid  compatibility and stability issues with compilers other than Visual C++.  It is important that if an ACSIL function you have created  uses this function, that you recompile for this version or higher.</li>
    
    <li>DTC messages s_MarketDepthUpdateLevelCompact2, s_MarketDepthFullUpdate20, s_MarketDepthFullUpdate10 removed for DTC protocol service client and server. If any of these messages are being used by a DTC  server or client, it is necessary to use other available DTC messages which have replaced them. The messages, s_MarketDepthFullUpdate10/20, have never been considered efficient messages and should not be used any longer.</li>
    
    <li>Replaced s_MarketDepthUpdateLevelCompact with s_MarketDepthUpdateLevelFloatWithMilliseconds in the DTC protocol Server in Sierra Chart.</li>
  
    <li>The Intraday chart Session Times  will not be allowed to be changed when there is a change to the same symbol but a different contract month within a chart.</li>
    
    <li>This version supports more efficient  market data over the DTC protocol through new messages which do not transmit the timestamp when the timestamp has not changed.</li>
    
     <li>A new Symbol Setting has been added to specify the maximum number of depth levels when subscribing to market depth through the Sierra Chart Exchange Data Feed or the Denali Exchange Data Feed  and other Sierra Chart market data services.</li>
     
     <li>Corrected an issue with the  <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Translate Symbols to Current Service</b> feature where non-futures symbols on a Quote Board would have been cleared rather than left as is.   Also the  Symbol  Input in the Add Additional Symbol study would be cleared if it was not a futures symbol.</li>
     
     <li>Removed support for the TD Ameritrade trading service. If Sierra Chart has been previously set to use TD Ameritrade, the service is then changed to  <b>SC Data - All Services</b>.   If you are using the Sierra Chart/Denali Exchange Data Feed you will still have access to the futures data. In the case of stock charts, they can be set to periodically update. Refer to step 15 in the   <a href = "index765f.html?page=doc/SierraChartHistoricalData.php#SetupInstructions">Sierra Chart Historical Data Service</a> Instructions.</li>
     
     <li> This has been removed in version 2028: When a Chartbook is opened, the symbols are automatically translated to match the current service. So this removes the need in most cases to use <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Translate Symbols to Current Service</b>.  This command still needs to be used to convert the symbols for Symbol Alerts  and the Intraday File Update List. </li>
</ul>

    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer2021>2021 Release Date: 2019-12-02</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer2021">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>    
     
    <li>Corrected an issue with the starting calculation index for studies  when they need to start at an earlier calculation index  and when that index is  not a valid value.  This could happen when using the Current Price Line study  in combination with the Color Bar Based on Alert Condition study. This is one scenario. There could be others.  This problem would be causing a performance issue and is now resolved.</li>
    
    <li>In this release and recent releases, when using a   <b>Trade and Current Quote   Symbol</b> during a chart replay, this symbol will be ignored.  There are complications with using this during a replay.   However, this also creates a problem that when the replay finishes any remaining open orders, and all of the trading activity is no longer going to be loaded into the chart.  We are still working on a solution to this.   Most likely the  Trade and Current Quote Symbol will be used for replay and we will find another way to resolve the related issues.</li>
    
    
    <li> This version finalizes changes related to the routing of historical data requests for futures data.  This is due to some background changes with   historical data infrastructure for futures data.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Corrected a problem from version 2010 where when your operating system has been running for 50  days or more, historical data downloads  would improperly timeout causing missing data. This is resolved.</li>

    <li> The function signatures for ACSIL functions: sc.OpenFile, sc.WriteFile, sc.CloseFile have been changed to make the return type an integer  rather than a boolean type. Since a boolean type has different sizes based on the compiler. So this is not safe and can cause a custom study to have unstable behavior.  This change requires that any custom study using these functions be recompiled for version 2017 or higher. </li>

    <li>Working on support for historical data downloading for  custom formula symbols.  Later it is intended to support trading  for custom formula symbols.</li>

    <li>Within the Numbers Bars study, added a new Input for <b>Highlight Nonzero Bid&Ask at High/Low Threshold</b> that can be used to establish a minimum value that both the Bid and Ask must meet in order to highlight the Nonzero Bid&Ask at High/Low.</li>

    <li>In the Numbers Bars Calculated Values, corrected an error when determining the coloring for the developing bar in the chart when using the Background Coloring Based on Value Percent.</li>
    
    <li> Support for delayed streaming  CME Group exchange data.</li>
     
    <li> Support for direct integration between Sierra Chart and Microsoft Excel has been removed. One reason among others that support for Excel has been removed is that Sierra Charts internal core is no longer  going to be using MFC and interfacing  to Excel becomes very complicated  using the lower level windows COM functionality and it is not a well-documented area of the operating system.  We are working on alternatives to this feature, like automatic saving of the data on a Sheet used by the Spreadsheet  Study to a tab delimited file. </li>

    <li>Restored 32-bit version of Sierra Chart for the time being.</li>

    <li>Fixed a problem with the Numbers Bars Calculated Values studies for the background coloring by value percent, where the most recent bar could establish a highest or lowest value during bar creation. Now the most recent bar will not establish a Highest or Lowest value until it closes, and then only if the final value is a new high or low.</li>

    <li>Added an option to have the Numbers Bars Calculated Values studies Background Coloring Based on Value Percent establish the highest and lowest values from either all the data or from daily data.</li>

    <li>For the  Transact trading service, when connecting to the market data feed,  now using the address and port provided by the authentication API from Transact.   Since the server is now directly controlled by Transact, they can redirect users as needed.    We have been told, that recent   market data lagging issues with Transact have been resolved and using this version or higher which uses the address provided by Transact will resolve the problem.</li>

This is now resolved. </li>
    
    <li>  The CQG  <em>FIX</em> connection method is being discontinued in January 2020.   The  <b>CQG Web API</b> connection method is what users will need to use after this   time if you are not already using this method. This is controlled   through the  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Data/Trade Service Settings &gt;&gt; Service</b> setting. When updating to this version or higher, CQG FIX will no longer be listed and the service will be changed to CQG Web API if you have been using CQG FIX Trading.  When using the CQG Web API, and trading a trade only symbol, like one of the new  CME micro contracts, there will no longer be any order rejection message related to market data  not being subscribed because market data is now subscribed.

    <li>   Corrected a problem with the recording  of an end of batch flag  for market depth data  at the moment of when market depth data is subscribed to from the data feed, which could cause calculations for Bid and   Ask Depth Bars to be done at an incorrect time  resulting in a inaccurate value for the chart column  where the subscription started.</li>

   <li>Removed support for CTS  Hardware ID check  when using the CTS Trading service. This may prevent CTS users from using Sierra Chart  and the CTS T4 trading software at the same time on the same computer.    If you are prevented from using both  at the  same time, this is a CTS restriction. This hardware ID check was removed because it is part of the process  of simplifying the interface Sierra Chart  has to the operating system and consolidating operating system code into core locations, in order to make porting to another operating system possible and it also reduces the risk of any potential startup issues by removing specialized functions which were used in the hardware ID check. </li>
    
    <li>  Corrected a problem with the <b>Bid and  Ask Depth Bars</b> study when the symbol uses a Price Multiplier which is the case with the SC Order Routing service.</li>
  
  <li> Added support for compact JSON market data encoding for the Transact trading service websocket connection.  This will reduce or eliminate lagging data and also solves a problem  with corrupted  websocket frames with the binary encoded method, previously used,  resulting in lost connections.  </li>
  
  <li>Separated the Trade Orders, Positions and Balance window into three separate independent windows.    These are all listed on the <b class="menu_item">Trade</b> menu.

Millisecond time stamping support for market depth. There are many quotes in a CQG message, some of which have timestamps and some do not.

    <li> Implemented immediate displaying of dialog windows to work around an  <em>operating system level</em> problem where when opening a dialog window like  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Trade Settings</b>  the dialog window may not display. However, this causes though the dialog  windows to be located at the top left  of the parent window, rather than centered.   Hopefully, this is not going to cause a problem for most of you.  This change was critical because we have seen increasing number of reports of the operating system not displaying dialog windows.  We expect by the end of the first quarter of 2020 all of the dialog windows to be replaced with a new implementation completely developed by Sierra Chart.</li>
    <li>
 New ACSIL  functions added:  sc.StartChartReplay(), sc.StopChartReplay(), sc.PauseChartReplay(), sc.ResumeChartReplay(), sc.ChangeChartReplaySpeed(), sc.GetStudyProfileInformation(), sc.GetStudySubgraphColors(), sc.SetStudySubgraphColors(), sc.ApplyStudyCollection(), sc.IsChartZoomInStateActive(), sc.GetTradeStatisticsForSymbolV2() </li>
  
   <li>Additional updates  to the TPO Profile Chart study  to display TPO profile  values for each profile.</li>

   <li>Corrected a problem with subscribing to Transact symbols  when using the new  Transact websocket connection, when there are some lowercase letters  in symbol  which prevented the symbol from being subscribed to.  </li>

   <li>Corrected a problem when using both the Denali  Exchange  Data Feed, and the Sierra Chart Exchange Data  Feed at the same time and when the Denali  Data Feed   did not have any exchanges activated  which prevented the market data requests from going to the right service.</li>

    <li>Market depth data with just one level is now processed by the  <b>Bid and  Ask Depth Bars</b> study.</li>

   <li>New setting:  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings   &gt;&gt; Advanced Settings 3 &gt;&gt; Number of Levels for Bid/Ask Depth Calculations</b>.   This is used to control the number of levels used in the calculations for the   <b>Bid and Ask Depth Bars</b> study. </li>

    <li>Corrected a problem in the chart Trades list where regardless of how <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Advanced Settings 3 &gt;&gt; Use Symbol Commission  Setting in Trades  List and Statistics Calculations</b> was set,  the  Round Turn Commission was always used in the calculations  if it was set on the Symbol in the  Global Symbol Settings.</li>

    <li>In the case of when using CQG, there has been a  change where the calculations  for market depth pulling and stacking  and the totaling of the Bid market depth quantities and the  Ask market depth quantities on a market depth update are done after   all of the incremental depth updates are processed in a batch as they are given from the data feed.  Instead of after each one because the incremental updates will create an invalid order book until they are all fully processed in a batch. This is the only correct way to do this  and is an essential performance improvement as well. Otherwise,  there can be quantity imbalances between the  Bid and  Ask side until they are all done. It also needs to be understood, with the advanced market depth data processing that Sierra Chart now has, the highest accuracy of market depth data processing and presentation will only be with the <a href = "index97ee.html?page=doc/SierraChartRealTimeFuturesStockDataFeed.php">Sierra Chart Exchange Data Feed</a> or the new   <a href = "index2530.html?page=doc/DenaliExchangeDataFeed.php">Denali Exchange Data Feed</a> (a lower cost data feed) in regards to the CME markets because these feeds, utilize direct CME multicast feed  connections and everything is perfectly implemented right from the source.  Also unlike the CQG websocket data feed,  these data feeds use a very efficient protocol and are processed on a background thread within Sierra Chart.</li>

    <li>For the Transact trading service, added support for not connecting to the  trading orders connection so that market data can be used independently.  When  Transact makes the trading connection available, the trading connection will automatically work. </li>

    <li>New  TPO Profile Study Inputs to display  the TPO  fields of data which are displayed in the Chart Values window, above or below TPO profiles.</li>
    
    <li> When using the  Futures Trading Evaluator service, the   <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log  &gt;&gt; Edit &gt;&gt; Filter Initial Fills Part of Existing Position</b>, is always considered to be enabled regardless of whether it is enabled or not on the menu.   This is so that the first fill in the internal Trades list of the Trade Activity Log is always properly aligned to the start of a  Position.</li>

     <li>Second revision: We have completed and released the implementation of Sierra Charts own timer functionality. Completely replacing operating system timers used in Sierra Chart. This is managed in a super reliable way on a dedicated thread that only takes typically about 100 µs of processing time per second. This is a significant performance improvement. It should also reduce the incident rate, although low, of users  of sometimes not being able to see dialog windows when opening them. Since there are no longer windows created in the background for timers and therefore this reduces the windows resources used in the operating system. You can see the reduction of window objects by looking in the Windows Task Manager  <b>Processes</b> tab for the SierraChart.exe process. The <b>USER Objects</b> field, which may have to be added,  will be lower.

    <li>Update to Market Depth Historical Graph where bars that do not have any new data (due to disconnected from data feed) will not automatically fill in and display the last known depth. To fill in the missing data, set the option for <b>Extend Last Known Depth</b> to <b>Yes</b>.</li>

    <li>The new <b>Adjust Interval (MS)</b> setting on the <b>Scale Window</b> has been implemented for a Constant Range Scale.  It sets a fixed amount of time for the amount of time to take to adjust the scale to its new position, measured in milliseconds. The speed at which the scale moves will depend on how far the scale needs to be adjusted. In other words, the time is constant, but the speed is variable.</li> 

    <li>Corrected some issues with keyboard shortcuts from version 1945.</li>

 
    <li>With the Symbol Settings changes effective with version 1920, we have realized that when preserving the existing user set Symbol Settings by placing them into a separate file, that inadvertently some settings which were not user set were determined to be user set. This was due to  a difference between the stored Symbol Settings on a users installation of Sierra Chart and what the server has, resulting in various incorrect user set settings which can alter critical  defaults for Symbol Settings. These incorrect settings can affect routing of market data requests.  In most cases this is not an issue but there are some issues.
    <br><br>
    What we have done to solve this is that  when you update to version 1953 or any version after, there is a one time  rename of all custom symbol settings files. All existing custom symbol settings files will be renamed to have the prefix "version1952.". If  you have a lot of custom changes to Symbol Settings or new symbols you have added, it is necessary to go through  those files (example: version1952.CustomSymbolSettings.scdataallservices.xml) in the <b>SymbolSettings </b>subfolder and extract the settings that you need and put them in a new file named CustomSymbolSettings.[service code].xml where service code is the actual service code in the renamed file name. This must be done while Sierra_Chart is not running.
    <br><br>
    You will also need to make sure that  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Symbol Settings &gt;&gt; Use Custom Symbol Settings Values</b> is enabled.</li>

    <li>Keyboard shortcuts are now fully implemented  within Sierra Chart rather than relying upon operating system functionality. This should  eliminate problems related to keyboard shortcuts  that some users have occasionally where they are not functioning. </li> 

    <li>Added support for <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenGL</a> for improved graphics performance.  This is still a beta and can cause stability problems  and not all graphics output will be rendered correctly.  This is still a work in progress.</li> 

    <li>Added support for millisecond time stamping for market depth data. This ensures accurate matching of market depth data to chart bars of a short duration and around  the edge times of chart bars  when using the  <b>Market Depth  Historical Graph</b> study.  
    <br><br>
    This also ensures precise and fluid replay of market depth data. Millisecond support is only supported on some Sierra_Chart servers at this time.   All servers will be updated by July 21 assuming no technical issues. Additionally millisecond support for market depth data is only supported and is only assured to be accurate when using Sierra Chart provided data feeds.   This includes the  <b>Sierra Chart Exchange Data Feed</b>,  <b>Denali Exchange Data Feed</b>,  the Sierra Chart Forex/CFD data feed, and crypto currency data feeds. No other data feeds are supported for this functionality.</li> 
 
    <li>The calculations necessary  for the  <b>Bid and Ask Depth Bars</b> study is now done at a low level. Time and Sales data is no longer used. There are now 100% accurate generated  Open, High, Low, Close bars for this study.  And all of the recorded market depth data is now persistent when Sierra_Chart is restarted and when a chart is reloaded.   However the greatest accuracy will only be provided   when using the <b> Sierra Chart Exchange Data Feed</b> or the <b>Denali Exchange Data Feed</b>.</li> 
   
    <li>In the case of the DTC server in Sierra Chart, to take advantage of the millisecond market depth time stamping, it is necessary to set  <a href = "index7c96.html?page=doc/DTCMessages_AuthenticationConnectionMonitoringMessages.php#Messages-LOGON_REQUEST">LogonRequest.Integer_1</a> to 0x80 when logging into the DTC Server.  This should be combined  with a  <em>bitwise or</em> operator with any other flags set into Integer_1. The new message structure is <b>s_MarketDepthUpdateLevelFloatWithMilliseconds</b>.</li>

    <li>Significant performance improvements with Symbol Alert evaluation especially when the Number of stored Time and Sales records is high.</li>
 
    <li>Additional development related to the Transact websocket API interface. We expect to complete testing this week and release trading support.</li>
 
    <li>Corrected a problem during a chart replay when using the <b>Combine Trades into  Original Summary Trade</b> option in the Chart Settings where some trades would not be included in the chart during a replay.  This can be observed because the volume is a little less per bar.   This is now resolved. </li>

        <ul>

    <li>Added the ability to highlight the Best Bid and Best Ask within the Recent Bid and Recent Ask columns. The settings for these are under Global Settings &gt;&gt; Graphics Settings - Global (or Chart &gt;&gt; Graphics Settings) as the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Chart DOM Recent Bid Best Bid Background</li>
            <li>Chart DOM Recent Ask Best Ask Background</li>
            <li>Trade DOM Recent Bid Best Bid Background</li>
            <li>Trade DOM Recent Ask Best Ask Background</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        To display these backgrounds on the Chart DOM or Trade DOM, select the Enable option for the backgrounds.
    </li>

    <li>New options within the Market Depth Historical Graph to define the Range Coloring based on Actual Values rather than percentages.</li>
    
    <li>Effective with version 1934, support for direct use of the old Barchart Data Service has been removed.   The protocol for that service is very old and inefficient.  Historical data delivery is slow and interrupts the main thread.   If you are using that service, you need to change to the <a href = "index97ee.html?page=doc/SierraChartRealTimeFuturesStockDataFeed.php">Sierra Chart Exchange Data Feed</a>   instead or stay on an older version indefinitely. </li>
     
    <li>Resolved a problem with the profit trailing functionality for the Global Profit Management feature where the trailing would not take place if the increase in the daily net profit  at once was in a smaller increment than the amount <b>After Trigger When Daily   Net Profit Increases  By</b> setting.</li>
    
    
    <li> Resolved an issue with   both the Interactive Brokers and CQG trading services where when all of the Trade Accounts   associated with the connection to the Trading service   have no  Trade Positions and there were prior  Positions  in Sierra_Chart which later were closed out when Sierra_Chart was not running,  they would continue to be displayed. This is resolved.   If  you are using either of these Trading services you need to update to this version or later. </li>
    
    <li>  Made the Alert Manager window more compact and the different tabs can be selected through menu commands now which also have associated keyboard shortcuts. Added a new option to  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Settings &gt;&gt; Alerts</b> to cause an alert message to also be added to the   compact pop-up alert window. </li>
    
    <li>Added new ACSIL functions: sc.GetStudySubgraphDrawStyle, sc.SetTradeWindowTextTag, sc.GetStudyLineUntilFutureIntersectionByIndex, sc.GetTradingKeyboardShortcutsEnableState, sc.SetTradingKeyboardShortcutsEnableState, sc.GetFlatToFlatTradeListSize, sc.GetFlatToFlatTradeListEntry</li>   

     <li>Added support for the new Transact trading service websocket  connection.     Currently only market data support can be used. Trading support is not yet complete and order entry will be blocked. This new service can be selected through   <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Data/Trade Service Settings &gt;&gt; Service</b>. The name is    <b>Transact Trading WS</b>.   Once trading support is complete, this will become the default service for Transact users. Currently the service  cannot be used by users who have Sierra Chart accounts provided through Transact because the service cannot be changed in that case.</li>

        <ul>
    <li>Added support for Last In First Out order fill matching.  When using this matching method, this is less efficient than first in first out.</li>
  
    <li>The icons for tool related Control Bar buttons have been replaced with text due to the fact that these graphics look too small on high resolution monitors like 4K monitors.   The icon bitmap files are still provided with Sierra Chart and can be selected for those buttons by changing the image in the   <a href = "index6736.html?page=doc/ControlBar.php#ControlBarButtonProperties">Control Bar Button Properties</a>. These image files have the naming format <b>Button_#</b>.  You can view what the actual content of the image file is through the Windows Explorer. They are in the subfolder  <b>\Graphics\Buttons</b>  in the Sierra Chart installation folder.</li>
 
    <li>Corrected a problem from a recent release  where the response for order cancellations when  using the  Transact trading service were not mapping to the corresponding active working order within Sierra Chart.  Additionally, new order acknowledgments for orders entered within Sierra Chart  also were not mapping to the corresponding working order within Sierra Chart when using the Transact Trading service.  This is resolved.</li>

        <ul>
    <li>Updated the Market Depth Historical Graph Study to have the option of using Minimum Range Color values that will interpolate the particular color to use for a depth value between the Maximum and the Minimum Range Color settings.</li>
    
    <li>In the case of when using the Sierra Chart  Order Routing Service, if there is any rejection of an order modification or cancellation due to the trading server not having a connection to the TT server, there is an automatic reconnection to the next available server.</li>

    <li>In the case of when using the Sierra Chart Order  Routing Service, if there is any reconnection to the trading server for any reason,  the market data feed will continue to provide market data even when there is a connection to the next available server.  So the market data feed, will remain constant and not be interrupted.  This is a feature that is not available with any other service  other than LMAX.</li>

    <li>Completed implementation of new Symbol Settings changes. For complete details, refer to <a href="https://www.sierrachart.com/SupportBoard.php?ThreadID=41971">this posting</a>. Users set changes to the default   Symbol Settings are preserved upon updating although the posting says this is not the case,  but this will be the case.</li>

    <li>Efficiency improvements with the recording of market depth data and relaying it to sub instances.  All of this happens on a background thread when using the Sierra Chart Exchange Data Feed and other Sierra Chart market data services.</li>
 
    <li>Improved drawing tool performance.</li>

        <ul>

    <li> New ACSIL functions added:  sc.GetBidMarketDepthNumberOfLevelsForSymbol, sc.GetAskMarketDepthNumberOfLevelsForSymbol, sc.GetBidMarketDepthEntryAtLevelForSymbol, sc.GetAskMarketDepthEntryAtLevelForSymbol, sc.GetChartStudyInputString, sc.SetChartStudyInputString.</li>
    <li>   New Symbol Settings dialog. This is to support the new enhanced Symbol Settings functionality  being worked on currently.   Part of this functionality is to separate user modifications of symbol settings from the  symbol settings from the server so the user settings never get  overwritten.  This development is still in progress.</li>

        <ul>

    <li>  Removed support for Advanced Custom Studies compiled for version 1224 and earlier. These will need to be recompiled on this version or higher to use this version or higher. </li>
   
   <li>Can use absolute price values for the first offset for Attached Orders, rather than just an offset value.   This is supported through the  Offset Type setting on the Targets tab of the Trade Window.</li>
  
    <li>New  Global Symbol Setting to specify dates to exclude from chart. </li>
    
    <li>New scroll wheel options  have been added to General Settings supporting scrolling of the vertical price scale  in a chart  by your computers scroll wheel.</li>

    <li> Added triple redundancy for server connections for the SC Order routing service. This means there are now a total of three servers that can be  accessed  in case one  is unavailable.  Additionally, if an order is rejected because an order routing server does not have a connection to the TT FIX server,  which is very unlikely, Sierra Chart will now automatically reconnect to the next available server.  This ensures maximum reliability.    However, in this last case, you will have to resubmit the order.   Additionally, the TT FIX servers that Sierra Chart  order routing servers connect to, also have full redundancy  with a backup server that is automatically accessed in case the primary is unavailable.</li>

    <li>Continued small fixes and improvements with the new tab controls for main window Child windows and Chartbooks.</li>

    <li>Added Gann HiLo Activator study.</li>

    <li>Added support for all  data/trade services for the <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt;   Translate Symbols to Current Service</b>  command.   This will automatically translate the symbols  in the open  Charts and Quote Boards  which are formatted for a different  data/trading service  to the format required for the data/trading service Sierra Chart is set to  currently.</li>

    <li>Updated the Trading: <b>Spread Order Entry</b> study to be able to support working with market data that requires a price multiplier. One of these cases would be the Sierra_Chart order routing service that uses TT for order routing.    Previous to this version this trading study is not going to do the spread calculations properly in this case. This is now resolved as of this version.</li>

        <ul>

    <li>Bid size and ask size volume bar sizes  for the market data columns on a Chart/Trade DOM are relative to both the bid and ask size columns together. The same now also applies to the market depth pulling and stacking columns. </li>

    <li>In  Graphics Settings there is now the ability to enable and disable the Last Trade Price Box. </li>

    <li>Additional improvements to the new child window and Chartbook tab controls.   The color settings now are supported.  Double-click on a tab is supported to maximize a window.  And there are now arrow buttons to move the tabs left and right. </li>
     
    <li>Implemented support for Interactive Scaling on left side chart scale.   This still needs more work for support with the main price graph.  </li>
