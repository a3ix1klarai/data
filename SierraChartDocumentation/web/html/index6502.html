There are <em>not</em> version notes for each version. The main Sierra Chart documentation is updated as needed relating to the changes and additions.</p>

    <p>In addition to the below listed items for each version, there are also various low-level improvements, issues resolved, and small additions that a release has which are not listed.</p>

        <ul>
   
    <li>Improvements to DTC Server. This includes the modification of server side bracket orders. The server (when Sierra Chart is used as a server) modifies the attached bracket orders to maintain the original offset they have to the parent order, on a parent fill.</li>
  
    <li>Added support for LMAX Stop-Limit orders and resolved  a problem relating to the modification of a Stop-Limit order for services that do not support Stop order modification.</li>
  
    <li>Corrected a problem with TPO Profile Charts arising from a recent release where Letter/Blocks will be slightly misaligned when using a <b>Letter/Block Price Increment in Ticks</b> Input setting greater than 1.</li>
  
    <li>Additional functionality added to the <b>Relative Volume</b> study. Added the <b>Volume Average Type</b> Input which has the options <b>Average Volume</b> and <b>Median Volume</b>. These control how the average volumes are calculated. Added new Study Subgraphs:  <b>Average Volume</b> and <b>Average Cumulative Volume</b>, allowing access to the  actual average values instead of the Relative Volume percentages.</li>
    
  
    <li>Corrected a problem  with the setting of the ACSIL variable <b>sc.IsFullRecalculation</b> arising in a recent release.</li>
  
    <li>Corrected a problem from a recent release where some pricing data could potentially be skipped when filling simulated orders originating from  Charts/Trade DOMs and modifying trailing stop orders originating from  Charts/Trade DOMs. This did <em>not affect back tests</em>.</li>
  
    <li>Corrected a problem with the cancellation of Attached Orders when there are linked orders.  This arose in a recent release. In some cases some  Attached Orders would not be canceled when they should be.</li>
    
    <li>  Disabled use of server-side OCO orders with the FXCM Trading service because the FXCM server is no longer handling those properly.  We expect within the next 30 days to be releasing support for a new connection model for FXCM which will support full server-side OCO and bracket orders and have no account minimums. </li>

    <li>Fixed  a historical data issue with the Rithmic trading platform service relating to the downloading of 1 minute historical data from the Rithmic system.</li>
  
    <li>Added support for <em>forward curves </em> with the Continuous Futures Contract option.</li>
  
    <li>Added new Rollover Rule: "Number Of Calendar Days Before Friday Count Within Following Contract Month". This is used for the CBOE volatility Index futures.</li>
  
    <li>Added  support for LMAX  Trading service through central FIX order routing connection using the DTC Protocol.</li>
    <li>Menu commands have been added to go to prior and next Sheets within a Spreadsheet. Keyboard shortcuts can be manually set up for these. </li>
    
    <li>  Added a delay  before starting a historical data request  which occurs after subscribing to real-time data so that when the historical data download is complete, and if there is any small amount of data missing it is filled in with the real-time received data during that delay.</li>

        <ul>
   
    <li>There has been a change to the filling of simulated Stop orders. The changes are as follows: In the case where the Bid and Ask prices are higher than the last trade price, then a Buy Stop order will be filled at the last trade price +1 Tick.  In the case where the Bid and Ask prices are lower than the last trade price, then  a Sell Stop order will be filled at the last trade price -1 Tick.</li>
  
    <li>Resolved some  issues and made improvements to the DTC Server related to Trade Simulation Mode. The LOGON_REQUEST TradeMode setting is no longer used in the DTC Server. Instead  it is a combination of the Trade Account (whether it is a simulated account or not) and the global Trade Simulation Mode setting in the Server which controls whether a trade is simulated or not.</li>

    <li>Various work with the DTC Server in Sierra Chart relating to trading and market data.   The DTC Server for simulated trading is still undergoing testing and there may be some issues that still need to be resolved. </li>
    <li> Corrected a problem with the filling of simulated orders that originate from the DTC Server where incorrect fill prices may have been used. </li>
    
    <li>Improvements to the internal handling and logging of Order cancel rejections and order modification rejections. The DTC Server now will always provide consistent and reliable Order Updates for these.</li>
    
    <li>Corrected a problem from a recent release where when there is an order modification reject of a parent order, the Attached Orders were not restored back to their prior  prices. This is now solved. This was a problem that developed recently when Attached Orders are modified first before the parent order which is necessary to support the DTC Server in Sierra Chart.</li>
    
    <li>Corrected some issues with the Exporting and Importing of Trade Activity  Log data.</li>
    
    <li> Corrected a problem with the Time and Sales Settings window where it would not close when pressing the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
    
    <li>  Added new color settings to the <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Graphics Settings</b> window to set the text and foreground colors for all of the text based windows.

    <li>Prevented a usually unnecessary reconnect to the data feed when closing the <b>Data/Trade Service Settings</b> window and also when Symbol Settings are received. Both of these are the result of recent changes.</li>
    
    <li>Finished the development of the multithreaded and multiple connection DTC Historical Price Data Server. Only DTC Binary Encoding is currently supported.

When this Input setting is set, the chart fill space is included into the Volume Profile width of a developing period, allowing more space for a developing  Volume Profile to be displayed.</li>

    <li>When saving a single study as a Study Collection, and it is not in Chart Region 1, it will be set to be in Chart Region 2 and the  Chart Region height percentages are properly saved with the Study Collection.</li>

    <li>Added the <b>Automatic</b> option to the  <b>Maximum Volume Bar Width Type</b> Input with the <b>Volume by Price</b> study. It will select the period width until it exceeds the window width, at which point it will use the window width.</li>

    <li>Continued performance improvements with New Spreadsheets.</li>

    <li>Changes to Automated Trade Management where Market orders are not attempted to be canceled when orders are set to be canceled on entries, reversals, and exits because market orders cannot be expected to be canceled. Therefore, market orders are considered in calculations of working orders when combined with the current Trade Position Quantity, even if the variables to cancel orders have been set to TRUE/Yes. This functionality still requires testing. An automated trading system needs to be tested with this version and higher in Trade Simulation Mode to verify it will function correctly. Although we see no reason why any changes to an automated trading system would be necessary. The changes done are to ensure that automated trading works more safely since market orders cannot be expected to be successfully canceled under usual conditions.</li>

Added a new function to replace using INDEX and MATCH:  <a href="index8e89.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetFunctions.html" >GetCorrespondingMatch</a>. This function reduces calculation time by 96%. The MATCH function will also be optimized in the calculation time reduced for it as well in a future release. However, this new function will give the greatest performance improvements.

        <ul>
   
    <li>Added new setting to the  Interactive Brokers Trading  Service settings: <b>Maximum Historical Intraday Days to Download Limit</b>.  This is the maximum number of days to download when downloading historical Intraday data from Interactive Brokers directly. This is used to prevent very long downloads when the  common <b>Maximum Historical Intraday Days to Download</b> settings in  <b>Global Settings &gt;&gt; Data/Trade Service Settings</b> have higher values which are acceptable for other sources of historical data but not acceptable for Interactive Brokers.</li>
    
    <li>Added new order status codes and text strings to differentiate between pending child orders which are held on the Client-side or the Server side.  Due to this change, there is now a new order status code for child orders. This affects existing compiled automated trading systems in this version and higher. If your automated trading system relies upon the s_SCTradeOrder::OrderStatusCode variable, then it needs to be recompiled on this version or higher to function properly.</li>
    
    <li>Various other low-level improvements and issues resolved.</li>
    
    <li>Added new Price statistics calculations to the  <b>Volume by Price</b> study.  These are separate Subgraphs which need to be set to a visible <b>Draw Style</b> and they need to be enabled  with the <b>Calculate Mean Price and Standard Deviation Bands</b> study Input.</li>
