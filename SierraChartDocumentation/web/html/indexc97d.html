    <p class="GeneralBackgroundHighlight">The Sierra Chart installer and the Sierra Chart program are both 64-bit. You need to have a 64-bit operating system, to use them. </p>

    <p>The Sierra Chart program, the configuration files and data files are located in the folder where Sierra Chart is installed to or one of the subfolders. This allows the installation to be simple, self-contained within its own folder, portable, easy to backup, and allows you to install multiple copies of it. For additional information, refer to <a href="#PortableDesign" >Portable Design</a></p>

    <p>It is <em>not recommended</em> to install Sierra Chart to the <b>Program Files</b> folder on your system. For additional information, refer to <a href="#PortableDesign" >Portable Design</a>.</p>
    
     <p><a href="#Installation">Installation and Upgrading Instructions</a> </p>

    <p> The use of the Zip installer  is another way to install Sierra Chart. It is used to extract the Sierra Chart files into the folder where you want   to install  or also  <em>update</em> Sierra Chart.  <p>
    
     <p>This folder is normally  <em>C:\SierraChart</em>.  This is the folder you will want to use,  if you are installing and not updating Sierra Chart. Although you can install it into a different storage drive on your system.  </p>

    <p>  Using the ZIP installer  is very simple to either install Sierra Chart or update   an existing installation. Simply extract the files from the zip file into the destination folder.</p>
            
    <p>You can install Sierra Chart on any available storage drive on your system. </p>

        <p>The hardware requirements for Sierra Chart depends upon what you are doing with it.    Most desktop/laptop/notebook/subnotebook  systems can run Sierra Chart without any difficulty  including the Microsoft Surface Pro. </p>

        <p>The following hardware specifications,   are very much recommended for a fast system: 16 GB RAM, minimum of  4 core CPU,  and a SSD (solid-state drive). The more CPU cores and  memory you have, generally will be beneficial.</p>

        <p>A dedicated solid-state drive with just Sierra Chart installed to it is strongly recommended.  </p>
        
        <p>For the threading capabilities of Sierra Chart, refer to   <a href = "indexc0b8.html?page=doc/Features.php#Performance">Performance Features</a>.</p>

        <p> Beyond what is explained here, it is not possible to specify the hardware requirements  because this depends upon what you are doing with Sierra Chart and   the amount of CPU load it is presenting to the system.  And how many instances of Sierra Chart you are running. </p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#FastUpdate">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>Fast Update lets you update an installed copy of Sierra Chart very quickly. This is the preferred method of updating.</p>
    
     <p> This procedure can also be used to install/reinstall any missing Sierra Chart files which may have been blocked  during a previous install by security software on your computer, once you have resolved  this issue with your security software. </p>
     
     
    <ol>
        <li>Go to or run Sierra Chart if it is not already running. Sub instances of Sierra Chart started with <b Class = "menu_item">File &gt;&gt; New Instance</b> do not need to be updated.  They will automatically be updated to the same version as the main  instance they are started from when they are started.</li>

        <li>Select <b class="menu_item">Help &gt;&gt; Download Current Version</b> or <b class="menu_item">Help &gt;&gt; Download PreRelease</b> depending on what you want. The download will occur in the background. 
          <br> <br>
        There is no progress indication. If for some reason it fails due to an error, just repeat this step. If there is an error, it will be displayed in the Sierra Chart <b Class = "menu_item">Window &gt;&gt; Message Log</b>.</li>

        <li>When the download is complete, you will be notified with a prompt. At that prompt press  <b>Yes</b> to close Sierra Chart and run the installer.</li>
        
        <li>  If for some reason the installer does not run after Sierra Chart is exited,   then directly <a href="https://www.sierrachart.com/downloads/SierraChartFileDownloader.exe" >run the installer</a>.  In this case make sure you specify the correct   <b>Installation Path</b> in the installer. </li>
       
       <li>  To begin the update, press the  <b>Install</b> button on the installer window.   You may want to wait a few seconds to allow Sierra Chart to shutdown in the background before beginning the installation. </li>
       
       <li> When the installation is complete you will receive a prompt. Press the   <b>OK</b> button. Press the  <b>Close</b> button on the installer window to close the installer and run Sierra Chart. </li>

        <li>Just repeat these steps for every copy of Sierra Chart you have installed. Although as explained previously, you do not need to update sub instances of Sierra Chart.</li>

		<div class="member-link">[<a href="#Uninstalling_Notes">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>We do not use an un-installer for several reasons.  Sierra Chart is self-contained in one folder.  Therefore, it is easy to remove with simple deletion, so there is no practical reason for an un-installer.</p>

        <p>Un-installers, for safety reasons, do not remove all the related software files from your system, like data files and configuration files. Which means if you want to completely remove Sierra Chart, you would still have to manually delete the folder it is installed to anyway.  </p>

        <p>Sierra Chart  can also be installed multiple times to your system, an un-installer listed through the Windows Control Panel would only remove the most recently installed copy. Which may not even be the copy you want to remove.   While we could support listing multiple un-installers in the Windows  <b>Programs and Features </b> control panel page, there is no practical benefit to this to justify the effort. It only unnecessarily complicates things especially if the Sierra Chart installation folder has been manually moved.</p>

        <p>Sierra Chart  does not support un-installation through the windows <b>Programs and Features</b> control panel page. Additionally, that does not provide a clear and direct method to uninstall a program. Often trying to uninstall a program through that interface simply fails because you are asked for a disk or a location to the un-installer to proceed with the un-installation, which you may not even have or may not even make any sense for the particular task you are trying to accomplish.  </p>

        <p>We try to be as independent as possible from design flaws and problems in the Windows operating system and keep only to the basics for reliability and ease of use.</p>

        <p>How often have you tried to un-install a program and have it fail and then have the listing for the program still in the <b>Programs and Features</b> control panel page? We have seen this often.</p>

    <p>A <em> Prerelease</em> is the version of Sierra Chart  which has been most recently been released. As a general rule a version is released first as a prerelease and then becomes the main release anywhere from one day to two weeks later.</p>

    <p>It has all of the latest development and any changes. It may contain new features which have not yet been finalized, completely tested and require further review and consideration by us. </p>

    <p>In all cases the prerelease is stable. We would never  knowingly release a version of Sierra Chart which is not stable. In general it is not a problem to use a prerelease. If Sierra Chart Support recommends that you update to the prerelease, you should not hesitate doing so. </p>

    <p>You have the same percentage of likelihood to encounter a potential unexpected problem in Sierra Chart whether it is a prerelease or main release. In general, Sierra Chart is a very reliable program. New development and changes when released do function properly.</p>

    <p>Often a prerelease fixes some issues that have been discovered in the main release and therefore is better to use than the main release. </p>

    <p>Nevertheless, having said all of the above, the main reason the prerelease exists is because we want to catch any unexpected problem with the new development before it is released widely. Although the likelihood of this occurring is uncommon.</p>

    <p>Sometimes the Sierra Chart installer or one of the executables it installs will be flagged by antivirus/anti-malware software as being malicious or infected. This is a false positive and false positives are <em>not unusual</em>.  </p>
    
    <p> The consequence of this, is that you cannot use the Sierra Chart installer, the files that the Sierra Chart installer will install, get deleted or blocked. Or at some later time, your antivirus/anti-malware software blocks or deletes Sierra Chart executable  file(s) preventing Sierra Chart from being used or preventing it partially from being used like studies which are in separate DLL  executable files. This can even happen seemingly randomly without your knowledge. </p>

    <p>Programs like Sierra Chart which are completely safe can still get flagged as being malicious if certain patterns are detected in the  executable code or certain action patterns being performed by a program are detected.</p>

    <p>The antivirus/anti-malware scanner is <em>not</em> detecting a specific malicious program, but instead certain  <em>generalized patterns</em> in the executable code or actions performed which might indicate a match to a malicious program.  This is why false positives can and do occur. You can tell a generalized pattern is being used, if you see something like <em>Gen.</em> in the name of the detected infection.</p>

    <p>Even Windows operating system files have been flagged as being malicious preventing the starting of the operating system.</p>

    <p>Sierra Chart is not malicious software for the very simple reason that it is <em>not malicious</em> and is a legitimate and also widely used financial market trading and charting program. The code base is clean. When the executable files are distributed, they are freshly generated and distributed to users from secure systems. So there is never a chance  for the installer or files to become compromised or infected in any way. Also, it is the installer program itself which is usually getting detected/flagged by antivirus/anti-malware software.</p>

    <p>Confirmation that Sierra Chart is safe can be determined by the <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virus Total</a> website. You can upload a copy of the Sierra Chart installer or any of the executable files to confirm this. Normally there should be no matches. Or only one or two indicating whatever matches have been found are only false positives.</p>

        <p>In the event that your antivirus/anti-malware software is flagging Sierra Chart  as potentially a security risk or quarantining it, and therefore preventing you from installing, updating or using Sierra Chart, then temporarily disable this antivirus/anti-malware software on your system.  </p>
        
        <p>Then proceed to install Sierra Chart again.  This procedure will install any missing files that were removed by the antivirus/anti-malware software.  This will be the solution in most cases.</p>

        <p>The next step is to go into its exceptions/exclusion rule settings and prevent it from scanning or monitoring the <b>C:\SierraChart</b> folder.  This is the default folder that Sierra Chart is installed to. If you installed Sierra Chart to a different folder, then specify that folder. </p>

        <p>For further help, contact the support of your antivirus/anti-malware software.</p>

    <p>Sierra Chart is currently designed to run on Microsoft Windows operating systems.  Sierra Chart can be used on any computer running Microsoft Windows as long as  the <a href="#SystemRequirements">Requirements</a> are met.</p>

    <p>It has long been the intention of Sierra Chart to add support for other operating systems. As we began to look at this more closely we began to realize that technically this was more difficult than expected, and would detrimentally affect the current state of Sierra Chart in regards to performance, stability, maintaining a consistent state and look and feel between versions, and quality of support. However, we still do believe it should be the long-term objective of Sierra Chart to support another operating system if it can be done without creating these problems. </p>

    <p>To be able to do this in a way which does not detrimentally affect Sierra Chart,  it is necessary to make various internal changes to Sierra Chart to allow it to be ported to another operating system more easily. These changes are ongoing. Therefore, at some point in the future it will be much easier for Sierra Chart to be ported to another operating system. When that will be, we do not know. </p>

    <p>However, the other operating system that we would support would have to be the second most used operating system and be an operating system which is proven to be stable and well organized. Therefore, it will be most likely that if we add support for another operating system it would be the Mac. However, when the decision is actually made it could be another operating system. There is no set time frame for this since our development schedule is already more than enough busy with adding new functionality to Sierra Chart.</p>

    <p>Sierra Chart can be automatically started based on various conditions by using the Windows Task Scheduler.</p>

    <p>This includes automatically starting Sierra Chart on system startup and under various other conditions.</p>

    <p>The task scheduler is accessed through the Windows <b>Control Panel  &gt;&gt; Administrative Tools</b>.</p>

    <p>Sierra Chart can be used on desktop, laptop, and sub laptop computers that are running the Windows operating system. Follow the instructions in the <a href="#Installation">Installation and Upgrading Instructions</a> section for installation instructions.</p> 

    <p>If you want to use Sierra Chart on a mobile device running Android or similar types of operating systems, you will need to run Sierra Chart on a desktop, laptop, or server computer running Windows and then use a remote desktop type application on that mobile device to remote into the desktop of that other system running Sierra Chart on Windows and interact with Sierra Chart in that way.</p>

    <p>Anyone with experience on Windows knows that the process  of backing up and restoring Windows, is a difficult procedure which usually additionally requires  reinstalling of the operating system and the individual programs being used especially when restoring to different hardware.</p>

    <p>This whole process can go on for days, and take a long time to get the configuration back to the way that it previously was. The separation of executable program files, configuration  in the  operating system registry, and very separate folders for data simply is a broken up and confusing  design for a program like Sierra Chart and it does not follow this model. It is a confusing design especially for the average person and has proven that it creates a massive burden  and difficulty on the end-user when backing up and restoring a system. Also, an application program should never use the operating system registry.</p>  

    <p>Sierra Chart is fully self-contained in its own folder.   It is just a matter of  backing up its own folder and restoring it to put it back in its original state including all of its data files. It is that point blank simple. It is obvious where the Sierra Chart files are at all times. Sierra Chart also does <em>not</em> use the operating system registry. We believe that data files should not be scattered about your system in other folders, leaving you with questions as to where they are located and making the process of backing up more difficult. </p>
 
    <p>It is <em>not recommended</em> to install Sierra Chart to the <b>Program Files</b> folder on your system. By default Sierra Chart will not be installed into <b>Program Files</b> on your system. So there is nothing special to do. The <b>Program Files</b> folder is a protected folder on  Windows Vista, 7, Server 2008-2012, 8, 8.1, 10. </p>
    
    <p>Sierra Chart <em>may not function correctly</em> and have issues when installed into the Program Files folder unless you run it with Administrator level access. Running Sierra Chart with Administrator level access is for more advanced users.  The Program Files folder is not writable or writes are redirected to another location  and the other location is not obvious to the user. Therefore, when backing up Sierra Chart in the Program Files folder, you are not backing up all of its files. Additionally when Sierra Chart needs  to create a custom studies DLL file, it is going to be blocked from doing that in the Program Files folder. </p> 
    
    <p> Either use the default folder or install Sierra Chart into the  <b><em>[drive:]\ProgramData</em></b> or <b><em>[drive:]\Users\[username]</em></b> folder as an alternative.  So the proper strategy is to use the \ProgramData  or \Users\[username] folder for portable programs if you want to use a folder other than the default folder. </p>
    
    <p> Never in the history of the Sierra Chart operation have we ever had to struggle with extra time and have users suffer over issues with backing up and restoring Sierra Chart related to a broken up design where the program files, configuration and data  are scattered about a system. </p> 
    
    <p> Some types of programs like word processors and spreadsheet programs, should have the user created word processor and spreadsheet document files separate from the executable program folder itself.  Those types of files do not belong in the program folder itself. But belong in a separate program <em>data</em> folder.</p>

     <p>  Since the release of version 2177, Release Date: 2020-10-03, only a 64-bit  implementation of Sierra Chart is provided.  For 32-bit support, you need to use an earlier  version of Sierra Chart. </p>
   
    <p> The 64-bit version of Sierra Chart is compiled for 64-bit CPU architectures. The 64-bit version requires a 64-bit operating system like Windows 7 and higher.</p>
         
    <p> The main advantage of the 64-bit version of Sierra Chart is that it can access more than 4 GB of memory.  In cases where it is necessary, it is recommended that you consider using additional <a href="index9bbd.html?page=doc/NewInstance.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instances</a> of Sierra Chart  instead of using a single instance of Sierra Chart and having it use a large amount of memory far in excess of 4 GB.</p>
    
    <p>There are some operating system function calls which will be faster with the 64-bit version. For example, those function calls which involve  memory allocations and releasing are going to be faster. </p>
    
     <p>Other operating system function calls we would expect to be faster. The performance gain you will notice generally will be minimal because Sierra Chart, keeps interaction with the operating system to a minimum, and keeps memory allocations and releases to a minimum.  </p>

    <p>In an installation of Sierra Chart, the Chartbooks you have created, the historical chart data which has been downloaded, the real-time chart data which has been recorded, all of the global configuration, the  Spreadsheets, and any other settings and files, that you have set and have been created, are saved with that installation.

   <p> You will not lose any of your settings or data files, no matter the status of your Sierra Chart account, whether it has paid usage time or has expired  or if you log into a different Sierra Chart account  to that installation.</p>  
   
   
   <p> Furthermore, when you change to a different Data or Trading service  in your Sierra Chart installation  like to a different broker/trading service,  then you can translate the symbols in your Chartbook's,  Quote Boards  and anywhere else symbols are used, to match the current service with the  <a href = "indexa20c.html?page=doc/EditMenu.html#TranslateSymbolsToCurrentService">Edit &gt;&gt; Translate Symbols to Current Service</a> command.  </p>
