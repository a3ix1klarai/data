    <h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#Intro">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>Sierra Chart is well known for its advanced chart replay functionality. When chart replay is used with <a href="indexad24.html?page=doc/TradeSimulation.php">Trade Simulation Mode</a>, you have a very powerful trade simulation platform.</p>

    <p>The Chart Replay feature is used to replay <em>Intraday</em> charts. Multiple charts can be replayed at the same time. To access the Chart replay feature, select  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Replay Chart &gt;&gt; Replay Chart</b> on the menu to open the floating control panel.</p>
    
    <p>This control panel can be always visible and moved anywhere you like. It contains controls for controlling the replay, allows you to set the jump time, replay speed, and an option to replay all the charts in your Chartbook. Your replay speed can be slower than normal speed or much faster.</p>

    <p>Market Depth data, if available, can also be recorded and replayed.</p>

    <p>The Time and Sales window for the chart will display the individual trades during a chart replay, assuming the data in the chart data file is stored tick by tick. </p>

    <p>Only Intraday data in the Sierra Chart <b>scid</b>  (Sierra Chart Intraday data) file format can be replayed. By default this is the file format that Sierra Chart uses when Intraday data is stored from the integrated Data/Trading services.</p>

    <p>If you have opened an Intraday chart from Intraday data that is in a text format, you first need to <a href="index0cb7.html?page=doc/ImportExport.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Import</a > it before you can replay it. You should easily be able to import the data, as various text data line formats are supported.</p>

    <h2 id="BasicInstructions">Basic Chart Replay Instructions</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#BasicInstructions">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <ol>
    
        <li> Open a new chart or go to an existing open chart. For instructions, refer to <a href = "index03a9.html?page=doc/GettingStarted.php#OpenChart">Open Charts</a>. A replay can only be started from a standard   chart. A replay cannot be started from a Trading DOM window which has no scrollbar, and no visible bars loaded.</li>
        
        <li>Select  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Replay Chart &gt;&gt; Replay Chart (Control Panel)</b> on the menu. Or press the <b>Rpl</b> <a href="index6736.html?page=doc/ControlBar.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Control Bar</a> button. 
        <br> <br>
        If the Chart Replay window does not appear, then refer to <a href="#NotVisible">Chart Replay Window Not Visible</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the case of a detached chart, you must select <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Replay Chart &gt;&gt; Replay Chart (Control Panel)</b> on the detached chart menu so that the Replay Chart window is opened with the detached chart as the owner. Or if the detached chart has a Control Bar,  press the <b>Rpl</b> button on the Control Bar.
        </li>
        
        <li>Important: On the Chart Replay window be sure to <em>uncheck <b>Use Start Date-Time</b></em>  unless you want to specify the starting Date and Time directly on the Chart Replay control panel.         
                     
        <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/replaycontrolpanel_startdatetime.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/replaycontrolpanel_startdatetime.png" alt="" class="screenshot" loading="lazy"></a></div>
        
        <br> <br>  
        If you are using <b>Use Start Date-Time</b>, then skip the next step.  However, in this case it is essential that you ensure that the first Date-Time you want to replay is actually in the chart. Go to the beginning of the chart with  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Goto Beginning of Chart</b> and look at the first Date-Time in the chart. You can tell by looking at the timescale at the bottom.  To load more data in the chart, refer to <a href="indexcf3b.html?page=doc/HistoricalIntradayData.html#DownloadingViewingMoreHistoricalIntradayData" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downloading/Viewing More Historical Intraday Data</a>.
         <br> <br>
        <span class="GeneralBackgroundHighlight"> If you are starting a replay at a Date-Time which is not in the chart, then there is going to be unexpected behavior with the replay.</span>
        </li>

        <li>Scroll the chart back to where you want to begin the replay. Use the scroll bar at the bottom of the chart to scroll the chart back. You can also press the <b>Home</b> key on the keyboard to go to the beginning of the chart. Refer to the image below.
            <br> <br>
            If you cannot scroll back to the point in time where you wish to begin the replay, then  select <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b> and increase the <b>Days to Load</b>. Press <b>OK</b> to close the <b>Chart Settings</b> window.  Also, increase the chart bar spacing by pressing the Up Arrow key on your keyboard.
            <br> <br>
            If you wish to replay data from an earlier date than what is shown in the <b>Date Range in File</b> box, then refer to <a href="indexcf3b.html?page=doc/HistoricalIntradayData.html#DownloadingViewingMoreHistoricalIntradayData" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downloading/Viewing More Historical Intraday Data</a> to access more historical Intraday data.</li>

        <li>Set the <b>Speed</b> to what you want to use. If this is your first time with a replay, try running at about 30 or 60 times in order for it to be more obvious a replay is occurring.</li>
        
         <li> Set the <a href = "#ReplayControl_ChartsToReplay"  >Charts to  Replay</a> setting to the particular charts you want to replay. If you are just getting started with chart replay, we recommend using just  <b>Single Chart</b>.  </li>

        <li>Press the <b>Play</b> button to start the replay.</li>
        
        
        <li>You will receive a prompt named <a href="#ClearTradeDataOptions">Clear Trade Data </a>. Choose the appropriate option.             
        </li>
        
        
        
        <li> In this image, you can see the indicators which indicate that a chart is replaying:
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <a href="../images/chartreplayindicator.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/chartreplayindicator.png" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" width="500" alt=""></a>
            </div>     
       </li>   
        
        <li>If you do not see the chart advancing to the next bar when you expect it should, there can be two possibilities. The first step is to increase the replay <b>Speed</b> because it is not fast enough. Try increasing the <b>Speed</b> to 120. If that speed does not cause new chart bars to appear, increase the <b>Speed</b> to 1440 for the purpose of confirming the replay functionality is working, and to advance to a point in time where there is data.</li>
        
        <li>  In the rare case, there is missing data in the chart or out of order data which is impacting the  replay, re-download all the data in the chart by going to the chart and selecting <b class="menu_item">Edit  &gt;&gt; Delete All Data and Download</b>.   You just need to do this once on any chart for the symbol being replayed. </li>

        
       <li>The next step is to enable <b>Skip Empty Periods</b> on the Chart Replay window. For more information about this setting, refer to <a href="#AutomaticSkippingOfPeriodsWhereThereIsNoTradingAndSynchronization">Automatic Skipping of Periods Where There Is No Trading and Synchronization</a>. 
       <br> <br>
       Even with this option enabled, you may still have to wait up to about 65 seconds for the next bar to appear based upon the replay Speed you are using, the <b>Intraday Data Storage Time Unit</b> setting, and whether or not trading has occurred at the point in time in the chart you are replaying. For some additional information about this, refer to <a href="#HistoricalIntradayDataRecordTimeframeEffect">Historical Intraday Data Record Timeframe Effect on Replays</a>.</li>

        <p>This button begins or resumes a replay on the active chart. When starting a replay, the first step is to <em>scroll your chart back</em> so that the bar you want to begin the replay at, is the last bar in view on the chart.

            <p>When starting a replay or jumping back in time, keep in mind that the chart needs to be <em>reloaded</em>, which can be time-consuming, and therefore it is important that you set the <b>Days to Load</b> to the minimum number of days possible in <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt;  Chart Settings</b>.</p>
            
            <p>If you need to replay data that is far back in time and want to load a minimum number of days, then set the <b>Use Date Range &gt;&gt; From</b> and <b>Use Date Range &gt;&gt; To</b> in <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b> to the date range that you want to replay.

            <p> When you start a replay and new bars do not appear, then this can be for two possible reasons:</p>
            
            <p>1. You are running a replay at too slow of a speed, <b>Speed = 1.0</b> (equivalent to real-time), and the underlying data in the data file has a high timeframe per record such as 1 Minute. Therefore, you would only see a new bar appear every minute assuming there is some trading activity every minute. Increase the replay <b>Speed</b> in this case.</p>
            
            <p>2. There is infrequent trading activity at the time you are performing a replay. When you perform a replay at a time in the chart where there has been minimal trading going on, then bars will be appearing infrequently. This is especially true if you are replaying at a slow replay Speed.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>By Time (hh:mm:ss.ms)</b>: The amount to jump forward or backward is defined by an amount of time in hours (hh), minutes (mm), seconds (ss), and milliseconds (ms) from the current position.</li>
                
                <li><b>By Number of Trades</b>: The amount to jump forward is defined by a number of trades that has occurred from the current position.</li>

            <p>The entry of the unit changes depending on the setting of the <b>Method</b>. When <b>Method</b> is set to <b>By Time</b> then the <b>Unit</b> values are entered in the form <b>hh:mm:ss.ms</b> where h=hours, m=minutes, s=seconds, and ms=milliseconds. When <b>Method</b> is set to <b>By Number of Trades</b> then the <b>Unit</b> values are entered as integers for the number of trades.</p>
            
            
            <p> It is important to understand that you cannot specify hours as 24 or Minutes as 60 or Seconds as 60.  24 hours would need to be specified as   <em>23:59:59.999</em>. 60 minutes would be specified as <em>1:00:00.000</em>. 1 minute would be specified as  <em>00:01:00.000</em>. </p>

            <p>This is the jump forward button. It jumps the replay forward by the amount specified in the <b>Unit</b> edit box on the Replay Control Panel. When you use this jump button, the chart is loaded to the last time displayed in the replay of the chart plus the jump amount. </p>

            <p>If you have paused one or more charts being replayed, and then you use the  <b>&gt;&gt; (Jump Forward)</b> button  to step through them, the charts will momentarily <em>play</em> to do the jump.

            <p>When you are replaying multiple charts by using <b>Charts to Replay &gt;&gt; All Charts in Chartbook</b>, they will remain synchronized.

            <p><b class="GeneralBackgroundHighlight">Days to Load Setting:</b> When replaying multiple Intraday charts with the <b>Charts to Replay &gt;&gt; All Charts in Chartbook </b> option, you will <em>need</em> to make sure the <b>Use Number of Days to Load &gt;&gt; Days to Load</b> setting in <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b> for any other charts being replayed, is set to the <em>same or greater</em> value than the chart you are controlling the replay from.</p>

            <p>For example, if in the current chart you are controlling the replay from, you have <b>Days to Load</b> set to <em>20</em> days and you are starting a replay from the beginning of the chart, then you need to make certain the other charts and Trade DOM windows in the same Chartbook also have <b>Days to Load</b> set to 20 or higher. This is especially true for the <b>Trade DOM</b> charts (<b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Open Trading DOM</b>), in case you want to do simulated trading with a <b>Trade DOM</b>.</p>

            <p>By default Trade DOMs only load 1 day. Additionally, the <b>Session Times</b> in Chart Settings should be identical for all the charts or they should be set to 00:00:00 to 23:59:59. Otherwise, the replay may not run in the other charts at certain times and you may also have synchronization issues.</p>

It is less efficient and only designed for automated trade system back testing.</p>

            <p>The Time and Sales window for the chart that is being replayed is supported during a replay and will display trades as they occur. The Time and Sales window will accurately display the true historical trades if the Intraday data file contains tick by tick data. Otherwise, there will be one trade each displayed for each of the Open, High, Low, Close values of the underlying data records in the Intraday data file.</p>           


            <h4>Calculate Same as Real Time</h4>

            <p> This mode performs  a calculation for the studies after the amount of time that elapses during the replay is equal to the  <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#ChartUpdateInterval">Chart Update Interval</a>.</p>


            <h4>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</h4>

            <p>If you are performing a replay based back test of an automated trading system when using the <a href="indexf70c.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetSystemsAlertsAndAutomatedTrading.php">Spreadsheet System for Trading</a> study or an Advanced Custom Study that uses the <a href="index2bf5.html?page=doc/ACSILTrading.html">ACSIL Trading</a> functions, then you need to set the Replay Mode to <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b>.</p> 
            
            <p>When you use <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b>, the study functions on the chart are going to be called/calculated whenever the High, Low, or Last prices of the latest bar currently loaded into the chart change or there is a new bar added to the chart during the processing of the underlying data records in the Intraday chart data file. This provides a combination of accuracy and efficiency. It will give a <em>consistent</em> result every time you perform a back test of your trading system.</p>
  
            <p> If there is a change with the Bid or Ask prices, which are stored with 1 Tick Intraday data, but the High, Low, Last trade prices of the last bar in the chart do not change or there are no new bars added to the chart, the studies on the chart will <em>not</em> be calculated.</p> 
            
            <p>Although, any working Simulated orders can still be <a href="indexad24.html?page=doc/TradeSimulation.php#HowOrdersAreFilled">filled</a> from these Bid and Ask prices as they are processed from the Intraday data file. An ACSIL study can be aware of all of the  Bid and Ask price changes by using the <a href="indexb9b8.html?page=doc/ACSIL_Members_Functions.html#scGetTimeAndSales">sc.GetTimeAndSalesData</a> function the next time the study function is called.</p>

            <p>When you have enabled <b>Charts to Replay &gt;&gt; All Charts in Chartbook | Charts with Same Link Number </b> and you are using <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b>, then in this case there is a <em>multiple chart synchronized replay</em> being performed.</p>  
                        
            <p> When there is a multiple chart synchronized replay, the studies are <em> called/calculated</em> whenever the High, Low, or Last prices of the current bar changes or there is a new bar added to the chart during the processing of the data records in the Intraday chart data file.  This ensures consistency with  multiple chart back tests no matter what the replay speed is.</p>

            <p>It needs to be noted, that back testing does not give results which will be exactly what you receive in real-time. This is not possible for various reasons. The actual bid and ask prices are not known and it is not known where in the order queue your order exists. There can be other factors as well.</p> 

            <p>When using <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b>, Filled and Canceled orders will be removed from the Trade Orders list, so it does not become full of too many orders and slow down processing.</p>
            
            <p>When using <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b>, momentary freezing of the Sierra Chart user interface is not unusual because there is a large amount of processing done before the thread processing that data yields back to the user interface of Sierra Chart.</p>
            
            <p>When there is a <em>multiple chart</em> synchronized replay,  the amount  of time  of data which is processed in each chart at a time, is prompted for when the replay is started during a multiple chart synchronized replay  with the <b>Enter Processing Step in Seconds</b> prompt.  This also applies when using the <b>Calculate at Every Tick/Trade</b>   Replay Mode.  Therefore, if you use a processing step of 5 seconds, then  5 seconds of trades will be processed at once before the next chart is processed.</p>
            

            <h4>Calculate at Every Tick/Trade</h4>
            
            <p>When using <b>Calculate at Every Tick/Trade</b>, this is identical to the <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b> Replay Mode, except that the study functions on the chart are going to be called/calculated for each data record in the Intraday data file. Therefore, when using tick by tick intraday data this is a very high accuracy, but inefficient, Back Test.</p>
            
            <p>In the case where an Intraday data record has a timeframe of greater than 1  Tick/Trade, and you need to be aware of when this is the case, then there will be price and volume data consisting of more than one  Tick  added to the chart bars before the study function is called. </p>
            
            <p>All of the other information in the <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b> section applies to this Replay Mode as well.</p>
            
            
            <p> When multiple charts are being replayed when using  <b>Calculate at Every Tick/Trade</b>  and you are prompted for the <b>Processing Step In Seconds</b> even though there is a calculation at every tick, there still are multiple ticks processed per chart for the specified time increment in seconds before going onto the next chart to be calculated.  </p>

     <p>When starting a chart replay from a stopped state,   <em>not a paused state</em>, you will receive  a list of options for clearing trade data for the Symbol and Trade Account of the chart.    </p>
     
      <p>This data includes Trade  Activity Data,  open and  finished orders, and the  Trade Position data.   </p>
     
     <p>The purpose of clearing this data, is so that if a replay is being done for the purpose of trading,   the data related to prior trades is removed so that the new trades do not get mixed in with the old trades.  </p>
    
     <p>If you want to maintain the existing trades from a prior back test, then before starting the replay,  <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#SelectingTradeAccount">change the Trade Account</a>  on the Trade Window to a different account  for the next replay to avoid conflicting  trading data.</p>

		<li><b>Clear All Trade Data for Symbol and Account</b>: When choosing this option,  all prior trading data for the Symbol and Trade Account is cleared. </li>

		<li><b>Clear Trade Data from Start Date-Time for Symbol and Account</b>:  When choosing this option,  trading data for the Symbol and Trade Account is cleared from the starting Date-Time of the replay.  When this type of operation is performed, it is performed asynchronously and  takes some time for it to complete. Normally this is going to be less than one  second. It should be very fast.  So therefore, before actually trading in the chart, it is necessary for this operation to complete. So the chart is placed into a Paused state when you start a replay.
         <br> <br>
           To resume the replay simply press the  <b>Play</b> button on the Replay window. If you do not want to have the replay paused, then do not use this option.

    <p>During a chart replay of an Intraday chart, the replay simulates real-time updating and is also affected by the <b>Replay Speed</b>.</p>

    <p>What this means is that when the Replay Speed is 1, then trading that occurred over a 1 minute period will take 1 minute to replay. When the Replay Speed is increased to 2, then it will take 30 seconds to replay 1 minute of trading.</p> 

    <p>It is important to be aware, that when periods of <em>no trading</em> are encountered in the Intraday chart, that the replay will pause until the replay time, which is affected by the replay speed, catches up to new data with a time equal to or less than the replay time.</p>

    <p>When the <b>Skip Empty Periods</b> option is enabled, then when encountering a period of time in the chart where you will have to wait <em>65 seconds or more</em>, that period is instantly skipped over and the replay continues. This is also true when replaying multiple charts when using <b>Charts to Replay &gt;&gt;  All Charts in Chartbook</b>, unless <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b> is selected on the Chart Replay window. In this last case, the data will not be instantly skipped over.</p>
    
    <p>It is also important to be aware that when a chart is replayed at an accelerated speed, there is a greater probability of encountering a period of time where the chart pauses when there is no trading activity because the amount of time to wait will be less than 65 seconds because of the acceleration. You will notice that when reducing the Replay Speed at these points, then the period of time where there is no trading will then be instantly skipped over. So in this case it is recommended reduce the Replay Speed to 1 and enable  <b>Skip Empty Periods</b>. The period of time of no trading will get skipped over instantly.</p>

    <p>When data is encountered in the Intraday chart data file which is outside of the <b>Session Times</b> defined in  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Session Times</b> <em>and</em> the <b>Skip Empty Periods</b> option is enabled, then that data is instantly skipped over and the replay continues. This is also true when replaying multiple charts when using <b>Charts to Replay &gt;&gt;  All Charts in Chartbook</b>, unless <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b> is selected on the Chart Replay window. In this last case, the data will not be instantly skipped over.</p>

    <p>When you have selected <b>Charts to Replay &gt;&gt; All Charts in Chartbook</b> and you have selected <a href="#ReplayControl_ReplayMode">Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</a> for the Replay Mode, then in this case there is a <em>multiple chart synchronized</em> replay being performed. The <b>Skip Empty Periods</b> option does <em>not apply</em> in this case. In this case the charts are always kept synchronized regardless of the <b>Skip Empty Periods</b> setting.  In this case to skip over a period of time where there is no trading, increase the <a href="#ReplayControl_ReplaySpeed" >Replay Speed</a>.</p>
       
    <p><b>Skip Empty Periods</b> also does <em>not apply</em> when using <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Auto Trade System Replay BackTest</b>. In this last particular case, the replay is run at the maximum possible speed. The speed is dependent upon the computer hardware.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#TradePositionQuantityDuringReplayAndJumpingBack">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>
    
    <p> The information in this section applies to version 2128 and higher. </p>
    
  <p>  During a Chart Replay, the Position Quantity at the current time of the replay is based upon  the order fills   available in the Trade Activity Log for the Symbol in Trade Account of the chart,  <em>up to the current Date-Time of the replay</em>.</p>
  
   <p>For a detailed explanation of the Position Quantity calculation method, refer to <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#TradeStatsOpenQuantityFieldCalculation">Open Quantity Field Calculation</a>.</p>
   
   
   <p> When jumping back in time during a replay, the Position Quantity can change if there were order fills which occurred after the Date-Time you jumped back to. Those order fills will no longer be included in the  Position Quantity calculation.  </p>
   
   <p>When those subsequent Date-Times are encountered in chart where the order fills occurred, they they will then be included in the chart and therefore also included in the Position Quantity.    So as the replay progresses after jumping back, and if you are not doing any new trading,  the  Position Quantity will change.</p>
   
   <p class = "GeneralBackgroundHighlight"> However, most importantly  When jumping back in time, you must  <em>never</em>  perform trading again during the the timeframe  that you   have jumped  back over.  If you do, this will result  in an incorrect Open/Close state of the order fills, an incorrect Position Quantity of the order fills,  and therefore cause various issues with the display of those order fills,  issues with the Position Quantity calculation,  and issues with order fill matching.  Therefore, trading again over the timeframe that  you have jumped back over, inherently is just  <em>not supported</em>  unless you  <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ClearingTradeActivityData">clear the order fills</a> first. </p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#HistoricalIntradayDataRecordTimeframeEffect">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>When replaying data, updating is <em>not necessarily</em> tick by tick. The replay will be in time units based on the timeframe of the data records in the Intraday chart data file. The timeframe of the data records depends on the timeframe of the historical data from the Data or Trading service you are using and the <b>Intraday Data Storage Time Unit</b> setting.</p>
    
    
    <p>  For example, if the  <b>Intraday Data Storage Time Unit</b> is set to 1 Minute and the replay speed is 1 times, then you will not see any updating of the chart more often  than in 1 minute intervals.</p>

    <p>Select <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt;  Data/Trade Service Settings</b> on the menu. Set the <a href = "index2c7f.html?page=doc/DataSourceSettings.php#IntradayDataStorageTimeUnit">Intraday Data Storage Time Unit</a> to a small setting for smoother replays. It should be at <b>2 Seconds</b> or less.  <b>1 Second</b> is better than  <b>1 Tick</b> for efficiency.</p>
    
    <p>The <b>Intraday Data Storage Time Unit</b> setting affects data <em>collected in real-time</em> and also affects historical data downloaded. For complete details, refer to <a href="index6d53.html?page=doc/TickbyTickDataConfiguration.php">Tick by Tick Data Configuration</a>.</p>

    <p>Depending upon the Data or Trading service you are using, there can be a mix of records with different time frames in the same data file. There can be 1 Minute data for some records and 1 Tick data for other records. So you may not always see consistency with the update interval during a replay.</p>

    <p>After you make changes to the <b>Intraday Data Storage Time Unit</b> which affects the data records in the chart data files, you will need to re-download all of the data in the chart data file for the symbol you are replaying because these changes will not affect the existing data in the file. </p>
    
    <p>To re-download the data, select <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Delete All Data And Download</b>. This only needs to be done once per symbol.</p>
   
    <p class="GeneralBackgroundHighlightLight">To visually observe a tick by tick replay, <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b> must <em>not</em> be set. This setting is meant for back testing and the chart will not be redrawn frequently but instead infrequently. The actual frequency of drawing is dependent on various variables and cannot be stated here. You simply have to observe it to see what it will be in your particular case. Also, the user interface of Sierra Chart can momentarily freeze when running a back test when using <b>Accurate Trading System Back Test Mode</b>.</p>

    <h2 id="ChartUpdateInterval">Chart Update Interval During Replays</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ChartUpdateInterval">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>During a replay, a chart is updated at the interval specified by the <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Settings &gt;&gt; Chart Update Interval</b> setting when the replay speed is 1. As you increase the replay Speed, the <b>Chart Update Interval</b> is automatically decreased internally in the chart to accelerate the replay intervals to make the chart replay more smooth.</p>

    <h2 id="ReplayingHigherTimeframeCharts">Replaying Historical Daily and Higher Timeframe Charts</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ReplayingHigherTimeframeCharts">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

	
    <p>It is not possible to replay Historical Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Yearly charts which are opened with <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Find Symbol &gt;&gt; Open Historical Chart</b> or <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; New/Open Historical Chart</b>.</p>
    
	
    <p>However,  there are two solutions to this.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to perform a  Back Test of an automated trading system, then use  the <a href = "indexe891.html?page=doc/Backtesting.php#BarBasedBackTesting">Bar Based Back Testing</a> method. This works with historical Daily and higher timeframe charts.</p>
    
    <p>   Otherwise, you need to use an Intraday chart where the chart bars are set to a timeframe of 1 Day or greater. Follow the instructions below to do this.</p>
	
    <ol>
        <li>Open an  Intraday chart by selecting <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Find Symbol &gt;&gt; [select symbol] &gt;&gt; Open Intraday Chart</b>.</li>
		
        <li>Select <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b> on the menu.</li>
        
        <li>Set the <b>Chart Data Type</b> to <b>Intraday Chart Only</b>. This control is located just above the <b>Intraday Chart Bar Period</b> frame.</li> 
		
        <li> Set the <b>Intraday Chart Bar Period &gt;&gt; Bar Period Type</b> to  <b>Days-Minutes-Seconds</b>.</li>
		 
        <li>Set the control under <b>Days-Minutes-Seconds</b> to <b>1-0-0</b>. This will set the chart bars to 1 Day per bar. Use <b>7-0-0</b> for Weekly bars.</li>

        <li>Set the <b>Start Time</b> and the <b>End Time</b> controls in this window to what you require. For more information, refer to <a href="index4ec1.html?page=doc/SessionTimes.php#SessionTimes">Session Times</a>. Using the default <b>Start Time</b> of 00:00:00 and <b>End Time</b> of 23:59:59 is acceptable.</li>

        <li> Press <b>OK</b> to close the <b>Chart Settings</b> window.</li>

        <li>Continue with the <a href="#BasicInstructions">Basic Instructions</a> to replay this Intraday chart.</li>

    <h2 id="SteppingThroughChartBars">Stepping through Chart Bars One by One</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SteppingThroughChartBars">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>
    
    <p>It is supported to step through the chart bars one by one manually. To do so, follow these instructions:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><a href = "index03a9.html?page=doc/GettingStarted.php#OpenChart">Open an Intraday chart</a>.</li>

        <li>Start replay of an Intraday chart as explained in the <a href="#BasicInstructions">Basic Instructions</a> section.</li> 
        
        <li>The <b>Speed</b> setting does not matter and can be anything.</li> 
        
        <li>Select <b>To Next Bar</b> in the <a href="#JumpMethod">Jump Method</a> selection box.</li> 

        <li>Press the <a href="#JumpForward">&gt;&gt; (Jump Forward)</a> button to step through the bars one by one. Each time the Jump Forward button is pressed, the chart will advance by one bar and the next bar displayed will be complete.
        <br> <br>
        In the case of Number of Trades, Volume, Range, Reversal, Renko, Delta Volume, Price Change, Point and Figure Bars, the very first trade of the next bar will be displayed and the last bar in the chart will consist only of a single trade.

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ReplayNotStartingAtSpecifiedBarOrDateTime">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>
    
     <p>When you  start a chart replay,   if you notice what appears to be a case where the starting Date-Time of the replay is not as intended, then one reason for this is that if there is a noticeable amount of time to load the chart when you start the replay, then as soon as the replay starts at the specified Date-Time or the bar you started the replay at, there is going to be a fast advancement, depending on the speed of the replay, from that bar due to the elapsed time of the chart loading.  </p>
     
      <p> For example, if the replay speed is 60 and it takes 10 seconds to load the chart, then the replay elapsed time will be 60×10 which  is 600 seconds. This is equivalent to 10 minutes. So although the chart will actually indeed start at the specified Date-Time, you will notice that it seems to start at a time which is 10 minutes later. </p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ReplayingNonSimulatedLiveOrderFills">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

     <p>It is supported to replay live trading activity so long as Sierra Chart has the order fills for that trading activity. You can view the order fills in the  <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php">Trade  Activity Log</a>. </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Select <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Connect to Data Feed</b>  in order to get the  list of trading accounts from your Trading  service if they have not been received during the current Sierra Chart session. However, the most recently used Trade Account will be  remembered from the last session.  So this step may not be necessary.</li>
        
        <li> Select  <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Disconnect</b> if you do not have a need to be connected.</li>
        
        <li>Enable  <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Simulation Mode On</b>.</li>

        <li>On the Trade Window for the chart you will be doing the replay from, select your live trading account identifier. Refer to <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#SelectingTradeAccount" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selecting Trade Account</a>.

        <li>Enable <b class="menu_item"> Trade &gt;&gt; Show Order Fills</b>.</li>

        <li>Perform a <a href = "#BasicInstructions">Chart Replay</a>.</li>

        <li>As the order fills are encountered according to the current Date-Time in the chart as the chart is replaying, they will be displayed and the current Position Quantity will update to reflect  these fills.</li>
        
        <li>   Only the order fills will display.  Working orders and Attached Orders will not display. Only the resulting fills from those orders.</li>

     <p>There are conditions after when starting a chart replay which can cause Sierra Chart to be less  responsive or in a frozen state for momentary periods of time.   Follow these instructions below to avoid this.</p>
     
      <p> You will first need to stop the replay by pressing the  <b>Stop</b> button if a replay is running. </p>
      
      <p> The information in this section  also helps reduce the time to start the replay. </p>

    <ol>
