    <p>This section gives an overview of the <b>Trade Orders</b> and  <b>Trade Positions</b> windows.  </p>
    
     <p>These windows are floating windows that have their own scope, so they can be open at the same time as another attached window.   </p>
    
    <p>For example, one of these windows can be open and it is possible to select <b class="menu_item">Analysis &gt;&gt;  Studies</b> and have the Studies window open and interact with both windows.</p>

        <p>This window lists all Open orders, both simulated orders and orders for the connected Trading service. Simulated orders are prefixed with <b>[SIM]</b> in front of the <b>Symbol</b>.</p>

        <p>When the <b>Status</b> of an order changes from <b>Open</b> or <b>Order Sent</b> to Canceled, Filled or Error, it will still be listed on this tab, but it is not persistent and will be cleared when Sierra Chart is restarted. There is no guarantee that orders other than Open orders, will be listed on this tab. Do not put reliance on orders other than Open orders from being listed on this tab.</p>

        <p>Left clicking with your Pointer on a column header will sort rows according to that column. When left clicking again on the column header, the sort order will change from ascending to descending or the other way around.</p>

            <p>Non-working orders from the Trade Orders list are automatically cleared after a period of time. This is done for performance reasons and is a feature in newer versions of Sierra Chart.</p>
            
            <p>To see these orders, the historical activity of the orders, and the order fills, refer to the <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log &gt;&gt; Trade Activity</a> tab.

            <p>Orders which are considered Open (Working) orders will have an <b>Order Status</b> of: <b>Order Sent</b>, <b>Pending Open</b>, <b>Pending Child</b>, <b>Open</b>, <b>Pending Cancel</b>, or <b>Pending Modify</b>.</p>

            <p>If there are open orders displayed on a chart or listed in the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Orders</b> window, and you know they are no longer open, then press the <b>Refresh Trade Data</b> button on the Orders window. If Sierra Chart does not receive any data for an open order from the connected Trading service, it will be internally canceled either immediately. Internally canceling means the order is not actually canceled with the external Trading service, it is canceled within Sierra Chart  which indicates it is no longer open.</p>

            <p>There can be certain scenarios why Sierra Chart may not have received a status update for an order and the order still displays with an <b>Open</b> state. For example, if you disconnect from the Data and Trade server (<b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Disconnect</b>), and then you cancel the order through another program, Sierra Chart will not know about this. </p>
            
            <p>However, when you connect again to the Data and Trade server, if Sierra Chart does not receive any data for listed orders that are in an <b>Open</b> state, they will be internally canceled. This occurs in about 5 seconds after the connection to the Trading sserver.</p>

            <p>Another step you can take if you question or have any issue with the Orders or Position data you see displayed on the Trade Orders window is to reconnect to the servers by selecting <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Reconnect</b>. </p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Entry Time</b>: This is the Date and Time that an order has been added to the Trade Orders Window. It is not necessarily the time that the order was actually submitted. 
                    <br> <br>
                    For example, when you connect to a trading service, the working orders will be requested and listed. If a working order is  received from the Trading service and is not already listed, then this will show the Date Time that the order was added to this list.  
                    <br> <br>
                    This Date Time is based upon your local computer clock when the order did not originate from a chart replay or back test. It does not originate from the server. This time is adjusted to the Time Zone setting in Sierra Chart. During a chart replay or back test, this Date Time is based upon the last Date Time in the replaying chart at the time the order was submitted.
                    <br> <br>
                    If an order has an incorrect timestamp or a slightly incorrect timestamp, then it may not match with the correct chart bar. It is important the computer's clock is set accurately when orders do not originate from a chart replay or back test. Refer to <a href="index3e87.html?page=doc/helpdetails38.html">Help topic 38</a>.</li>

                <li><b>Last Activity Time</b>: This is the Date Time that the listed order has been last updated. This is based upon your local computer clock and not the server.  This time is adjusted to the Time Zone setting in Sierra Chart. During a chart replay, this Date Time is based upon the last Date Time in the replaying chart and not the current actual time.</li>

                <li><b>Symbol</b>: This is the symbol of the order. If the order is not simulated and sent to the connected Trading service, then the symbol will have <em>no prefix</em> in front of it. If the order is being handled by the Sierra Chart Trade Simulation Mode, then the symbol will have the <b class="GeneralBackgroundHighlight">[Sim]</b> prefix.</li>

                <li><b>Order Quantity</b>: This is the quantity of the order. This can either be contracts, shares, or currency units.</li>

                <li><b>Price</b>: This is the price of the order. If the order has only one price, then this is the only price used.</li>

                <li><b>Price2</b>: In the case of <b>Stop-Limit</b> orders, this is the Limit price. Price2 is only used for Stop-Limit orders.</li>

                <li id="OrderStatus"><b>Status</b>: This is the order status. It can be one of the following: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Order Sent</b>: The trade order has been sent to the Sierra Chart Trade Simulation system or the connected Trading service. It will be changed to another order status once the Trade Simulation system or the connected trading service gives an indication that the order has been received.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the case of the Sierra Chart Trade Simulation system it will immediately change the status to <b>Open</b>. It will not remain in the <b>Order Sent</b> status.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the case of when an order is sent to an external connected Trading service, if the order is not acknowledged it will remain in the <b>Order Sent</b> status. In this case select <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Refresh Trade Data</b>. Either the order status will immediately change or the order will be canceled by Sierra Chart within one minute if there is no response from the Trading service for it.
                            <br>
                            <br> 
                            For some of the supported Trading services, if an order is in the <b>Order Sent</b> status for an extended time, Sierra Chart will try to request the status of it automatically. The progress of this is displayed in the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Service Log</b>.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Depending upon the Trading service you are using and the actual state of the order it may or may not be able to be canceled with a status of <b>Order Sent</b>.
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Pending Open</b>: This order status is only valid when an order is sent to the connected external Trading service. It is not used in Sierra Chart Trade Simulation Mode. It generally means that the connected trading service has indicated that the order has not yet reached an Open state and therefore it cannot be filled in this state. It should be possible to cancel an order in this state.</li>

                        <li><b>Open</b>: The order is in a working state and can be filled. It may also be partially filled and still working. In the case of a non-simulated order, the connected Trading service has indicated that the order has been accepted and it is working. It is possible to cancel an order in this state. In Trade Simulation Mode, there are no partial fills, an order is either completely filled or not filled.</li>

                        <li><b>Filled</b>: The order has completely filled or has been canceled before it has completely filled. In Trade Simulation Mode, there are no partial fills, an order is either completely filled or not filled. Generally there is no reason to cancel an order in this state, but it is possible to select the order in the <b>Trade Orders Window</b> and Cancel it.</li>

                        <li><b>Pending Cancel</b>: A request to cancel the order has been made and confirmation of the cancellation is being awaited. It is possible to attempt further cancellations in this state.</li>

                        <li><b>Canceled</b>: The order has been canceled. It is no longer working or in an <b>Open</b> state. It cannot be filled any longer. The order may have been partially filled. Whether a partially filled order that has been canceled will have a status of <b>Filled</b> or <b>Canceled</b> depends upon the Trading service you are connected to and what status they give. In the case of Trade Simulation Mode, a canceled order will always have a status of <b>Canceled</b>.
                          <br> <br>
                        A completely filled order can also have a status of Canceled if at the time the order status is checked, the order is no longer  available on the trading server, and the order in the Sierra Chart order list was indicated to still be Open at the time of the check.  This can happen if an order fills when Sierra Chart is not connected to the external trading server and later Sierra Chart is connected.
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Pending Modify</b>: A request to modify the order has been made and confirmation of the modification is being awaited. It is possible to cancel an order in this state.</li>

                        <li><b>Pending Child</b>: This order status only applies to <b>Attached Orders </b>. It means the order is being held by Sierra Chart until the parent order fills partially or completely. The orders can be definitely and immediately canceled in this state. When the parent order partially or completely fills, then the Attached Orders will have their Status changed to <b>Open</b>.</li>

                        <li><b>Error</b>: There was some error with the order. This could happen initially or at some other point during the life of the order. The reason for the error usually will be displayed in <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Service Log</b>. The line in the Trade Service Log will contain the order's <b>Internal Order ID</b> and <b>Service Order ID</b> for reference.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><b>Internal Order ID</b>: This is a numeric identifier that Sierra Chart internally uses to identify the order. This is always an integer value.
                    <br> <br>
                    In the case where you have more than one instance of Sierra Chart running and connected to the same external trading account, non-simulated orders will be listed in each instance and for the same order with the same <b>Service Order ID</b>, the <b>Internal Order ID</b> will be unique for each instance.</li>

                <li><b>Order Type</b>: This is the order type. It can be any of the supported order types.</li>

                <li><b>Filled Quantity</b>: This is the quantity of shares or contracts that has been filled.</li>

                <li><b>Average Fill Price</b>: This is the average price of all of the order fills in the order. An order can fill in one or more parts. If the Quantity of the order is 1, there would only be one fill. If there is any question about the fill price of a simulated order, then refer to <a href="indexad24.html?page=doc/TradeSimulation.php#HowOrdersAreFilled">How Orders Are Filled</a>.</li>

                <li><b>Buy/Sell</b>: This indicates the Side of the order. This can be either <b>Buy</b> or <b>Sell</b>.</li>

                <li><b>Service Order ID</b>: This is the order identifier provided by the external Trading service to identify the order. In the case of a Simulated order, using Sierra Chart Trade Simulation Mode, this will always be the same as the internal order ID.</li>

                <li><b>Good Till DateTime</b>: If the <b>Time in Force</b> is <b>Good till Date Time</b>, then this field indicates the order expiration date and time.</li>

                <li><b>Trade Account</b>: The account identifier with your Trading service for which this order is contained in. In Sierra Chart Trade Simulation mode, simulated orders will indicate <b>Sim#</b>. The # is equivalent to any number from 1 to 400 indicating what particular Trade Simulation Mode account is being used.</li>

                <li><b>Link ID</b>: An Attached Order that is in the <b>All Groups</b> OCO Group or a parent order, will be split into smaller orders if there is more than one OCO group used in the list of Attached Orders submitted with an order. When an order is split into smaller orders, they are linked together and this indicates the  Internal Order ID used for linking. It is the Internal Order ID of the first order in that group. When one of the orders in a group of orders linked together is modified or canceled, the other ones will be as well. This happens automatically.</li>

                <li><b>OCO ID</b>: If two orders are in an OCO (order cancels order) group, then this field will display the OCO Internal ID for that OCO group and it will match with the other order that is part of the same OCO group. The OCO Internal ID is the Internal Order ID of one of the orders in the OCO group.</li>

                <li><b>Last Order Action Source</b>: This field displays the source of the last action for the order and other detailed text information about the latest order action.

Although this will delay the sending of the market order.</li>

                <li>Enable <b>Position &gt;&gt; Cancel Orders for Symbol When Flatten</b> from the Trade Positions window menu, if you want all non-simulated open/working orders for the symbols having their Positions flattened, to also be canceled at the same time.</li>

                <li>In the list of Positions, select the Position or Positions lines you want to flatten. To select multiple Positions hold the Control key and select them one by one.</li>

                <li>  Select the <b>Flatten</b> menu command at the top.</li>
                
                <li>Or you can  select the <b>Flatten All</b> menu command at the top, to flatten all Positions regardless of which Position lines are selected. In this case there is no requirement to select particular Position lines.
                 <br> <br>
                
                When using this command there is always a prompt to confirm the  <b>Flatten All</b> operation. <em>All</em> Positions will be flattened/closed regardless of what is listed in case there is a Trade Account filter set preventing some Positions from being displayed.</li>

            <p>The following is a list of the fields for each symbol displayed on the <b>Trade Positions</b> window.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Symbol</b>: This is the symbol for which the Position data is for.</li>

                <li><b>Quantity</b>: This is the quantity of the Position. This will either be contracts, shares, or currency units depending upon the type of market the <b>Symbol</b> is for.</li>                

                <li><b>Trade Account</b>: This is the Account identifier for the Trade Position.</li>

                <li><b>Average Price</b>: This is the Average Price of the current Position provided by the connected external Trading service.
                
                <br> <br>
                The external Trading service may not provide a Position Average Price or it may not be supported by Sierra Chart for that service.
                <br><br>
                
                Sierra Chart also calculates and maintains its own Average Price for the Trade Positions which is dynamically calculated from the order fills in the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b>. This calculated Average Price can be viewed on a chart, Trade DOM, and the <b>Trade Statistics</b> and <b>Trades</b> tabs of the <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php">Trade Activity Log</a>. For more information, refer to <a href="#HowAveragePriceForPositionsIsCalculatedAndUsed">How Average Price for Positions Is Calculated and Used</a>.</li>

                <li><b>Open Profit/Loss</b>: This is the Open Position Profit or Loss.  This will not  be calculated and remain at 0 if there is no Position Average Price.</li>

                <li><b>Daily Profit/Loss</b>: This field is is used internally by a Sierra Chart server but it does not update  on the Trade Positions window for users.</li>

                <li><b>Daily P/L Reset DateTime</b>: This is the Date and Time that the Daily Profit/Loss will reset.</li>

                <li><b>High During Position</b>: This is the highest price reached while this Position is open.  It resets to zero when the Position quantity changes.</li>

                <li><b>Low During Position</b>: This is the lowest price reached while this Position  is open.  It resets to zero when the Position quantity changes.</li>

                <li><b>Last During Position</b>:  This is the most recent last trade price while this Position  is open.  It resets to zero when the Position quantity changes. In the case of Sierra Chart based order routing services, this will remain at 0.</li>

                <li><b>Margin Requirement</b>: This is the current margin requirement for the Position.</li>
				
                <li><b>Service Position Quantity</b>: This is the Position quantity for the symbol provided by the connected Trading service. The <b>Quantity</b> field is calculated by Sierra Chart by the order fills received. If the <b>Quantity</b> field becomes different than <b>Trade Service Position Quantity</b>, then <b>Quantity</b> is synchronized to the <b>Trade Service Position Quantity</b>.
                    <br> <br>
                    The reason there are two separate quantity fields is so that Sierra Chart can accurately determine whether a fill received is an opening or closing (entry or exit) fill. Sierra Chart cannot do this without maintaining its own independent Trade Position Quantity variable set from the order fill events received from the server.
                </li>

                <li><b>Currency</b>: This is the  currency code for the Position</li>

                <li><b>Entry Date-Time</b>: This is the Date and Time that this Position was entered.</li>
				
                <li><b>MaxPotentialPosQty</b>:  This is maximum potential Position quantity based upon the current Position quantity and working orders.  This field is only supported with Sierra Chart order routing and simulated trading services.</li>

            <p>In the case of one performing automated trading using ACSIL or the <b>Spreadsheet System for Trading</b> study, it is helpful to understand the following regarding the Trade Position Quantity fields.</p>

            <p>The  <a href="#PositionWindowFields">Trade Position Quantity</a> which is the Quantity displayed in Sierra Chart and given to automated trading systems is updated by fills/executions. It is not directly updated by Trade Position data updates from the external trading service.</p>

            <p>However, if the calculated  Trade Position Quantity from the order fills is out of sync with the reported <b>Trade Service Position Quantity</b> from the external trading service, then after about 8 seconds the order fill calculated Position Quantity will be synchronized to the Trade Service Position Quantity after there has been an unsolicited update of the Trade Service Position Quantity.</p>

            <p>If there is a solicited Trade Position data update, the synchronization happens immediately.</p>

        <p>There are some special cases where you cannot rely upon the Trade Position data from the Trading service you are using. An example of this would be futures spread/strategy symbols often do not have reported Trade Position data for them but instead are reported for the outright contracts themselves. Another case would be where Trade Positions are not provided at all, as is the case with the LMAX Forex trading service.</p>

        <p>In these cases it is necessary to use the <a href="#OrderFillCalculatedPosition">Using Order Fill Calculated Trade Positions</a>. In the case of TT FIX spreads/strategies and when using LMAX, the Order Fill Calculated Positions will automatically be used.</p>

        <p>To confirm you cannot use the Trading service provided Trade Positions data, select <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Positions Window</b> from the menu. If you do not see the non-simulated Positions that you have in your trading account, or the symbols for those Positions do not match the Chart or Trade DOM, then it is necessary to use the Order Fill Calculated Positions.</p>

        <p>For instructions to use the Order Fill Calculated Position for an individual chart or Trade DOM, refer to <a href="#OrderFillCalculatedPosition">Using Order Fill Calculated Trade Positions</a>.</p>

        <p>For various reasons, when trading some symbols through some Trading services or with certain Trading services, you cannot rely upon the Trade Position data provided by the Trading Service you are using.</p>

        <p>Trade Position data may not be available or it may not accurately track the true Trade Position Quantity for a Symbol and Trade Account. For example, when trading exchange traded futures spreads or strategies through some Trading services, no current Trade Position data is provided for that particular spread/strategy.</p>

        <p>Additionally, you may want to have a Trade Position Quantity reported in a Chart or Trade DOM which begins from a specific Date-Time independent of the actual Trade Position Quantity for the Symbol and Trade Account.</p>

        <p>Sierra Chart has a feature where you can see the current Trade Position Quantity and Average Price for a Symbol and Trade Account on a Chart or Trade DOM, calculated directly from all of the order fills Sierra Chart has for non-simulated trading for that Symbol and Trade Account.</p>

        <p>This is a method by which you can track the current Trade Positions completely independent from the Trading service reported Trade Position data.</p>

        <p>This feature can be enabled by <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#OpeningTradeWindow">Opening the Trade Window</a> and enabling <b class="menu_item">Menu/M &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt;  Use Order Fill Calculated Position</b>.</p>

        <p>Use this option to report the Trade Position Quantity and Average Price based strictly upon the order fills that Sierra Chart has for the Symbol and Trade Account the Chart or Trade DOM is set to. This command is <em>specific to each individual</em> chart or Trade DOM it is enabled for.</p>

        <p>You can switch in and out of this at will. If a fill is missed, Sierra Chart will attempt to download missing fills upon a connection to the server, so it can always accurately report the Trade Position for a particular Symbol and Trade Account.</p>

        <p>It is important to be aware that Sierra Chart needs to have all of the order fills stored in the <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php">Trade Activity Log</a> for the current order fill calculated Trade Position and the very first fill needs to be at a point in time where the Position was previously flat for the Symbol and Trade Account, for an accurate Trade Position Quantity and Average Price indication.</p>
        
        <p>Otherwise, the resulting Trade Position Quantity and Average Price will be inaccurate. In this case, refer to <a href="#OrderFillCalculatedTradePositionNotAccurate">Order Fill Calculated Trade Position Not Accurate</a>.</p>

            <p>Since the Order Fill Calculated Trade Position relies upon order fill data for a particular Symbol and Trade Account in the <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php">Trade Activity Log</a>, and not upon Trade Position data from the external Trading service, it is essential that Sierra Chart has all of the order fills that currently make up the current Trade Position for a Symbol and Trade Account and that those fills are accurate.</p>

            <p>Therefore, if there is any inaccuracy with the reported Order Fill Calculated Trade Position Quantity or Average Price, then refer to the <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#TradeStatisticsForChartsTab_SolvingInaccurateTradeStatisticsForChartsFieldValues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solving Inaccurate Trade Statistics for Charts Field Values</a> section.

    <p>Sierra Chart provides many studies that display trading information from the <em>order fill</em> data for the Symbol and Trade Account of the chart, in a graphical form for each bar in the chart.</p>

    <p>To add one of the studies listed below to a chart, select <b class="menu_item">Analysis &gt;&gt; Studies</b> on the menu and <b> Add </b> them to the chart just like any other study. For complete instructions, refer to <a href="index9099.html?page=doc/ChartStudies.html#AddingModifyingStudies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adding/Modifying Chart Studies</a>.</p>

     <p> It is essential that the  first order fill loaded into the chart is correct. For further information, refer to <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#UnderstandingAndSettingTheStartDateTimeForATradesList" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding and Setting the Start Date-Time for a Trades List</a>.</p>

    <p>When <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Simulation Mode</b> is checked, then simulated order fills will be used in the study.</p>

    <p>When <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Simulation Mode</b> is off/unchecked, then non-simulated order fills will be used in the study.</p>

    <p>With all of these studies, when there is no  order fill data for a particular bar in the chart, the study will carry forward and draw the prior value, if any.</p>

    <p>In the case of all of these studies, a <em>Closed trade</em> consists of a fill that increases a Trade Position and the subsequent order fill that fully offsets that increase in the Trade Position. The <b>Fill to Fill</b> <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#OrderFillMatchingMethods">Order Fill Matching Method</a> is used when determining a closed trade.</p>

    <p>For the trading studies that display Profit/Loss values, the format of the Profit/Loss value is dependent upon the <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Trading &gt;&gt;  Profit/Loss Format</b> display setting. </p>

    <p>Profit/Loss formats which use <b>- Ignore Quantity</b> will be considered the format without the Ignore Quantity. Therefore, if you select <b>Ticks - Ignore Quantity</b>, it will be interpreted as <b> Ticks</b>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Trading: Closed Profit/Loss</b>: This study will display the cumulative profit/loss from <em>closed</em> Trades that there are order fills for in the Trade Activity Log for the Symbol and Trade Account. All available order fills are included. A closed Trade is one in which there is an opening fill and a closing fill. A currently open Trade which has no corresponding closing fill is not included in the study. For further details, refer to the <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#TradesTab" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trades tab</a> of the Trade Activity Log.</li>

        <li><b>Trading: Daily Profit/Loss</b>: This study will display the cumulative Profit/Loss from closed trades for each day in the chart. Each day is 24 hours.

            <p>The <b>Net Profit/Loss</b> is the <b>Daily Profit/Loss</b> plus the current position <b>Open Profit/Loss</b>.</p>

            <p>When the Open Profit/Loss is combined with the Daily Profit/Loss (<b>Daily Net PL</b>), the Open Profit/Loss is calculated directly from the trade order fills  contained in the Trades list of the chart which originate from the <b class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b>. </p>
            
            <p>This Open Profit/Loss potentially can be different than the Open Profit/Loss that is separately displayed since it will use a FIFO method for the average price calculation and also has a dependency on an accurate Position Quantity Calculation.

             <p>The Open Profit/Loss in this case does not not use the current  <a href = "#HowAveragePriceForPositionsIsCalculatedAndUsed">Position Average Price</a> and the current Position Quantity. It uses an internal calculation for these which has a dependency on the order fills which make up  the open Trade Position.  If you are carrying a long-term Trade Position  and Sierra Chart does not have the trade fills which make up that Trade Position, in the <b class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b>,  then the <b>Net Profit/Loss</b> will <em>not</em> be accurate. </p>


            <!-- p>It generally is recommended to avoid using the Net Profit/Loss  value because it combines two different values which are calculated from the trade fills and if there is any issue with the trade fill data, then it will be inaccurate and hard to understand where the problem is.

        <p>When using one of the Trade Data studies that begins with <b>Trading:</b> like <b>Trading: Total Trades</b> or <b>Trading: Closed Profit/Loss</b> and there is not the trading data displayed for the corresponding chart bars when there are trades at those bars, prior trade data is not included, the data is misaligned, or the trading data is delayed before it is displayed, then this can be due to the following reasons given below.</p>
        
         <p> This information is also applicable to the <b>Trading: Profit/Loss Text</b> study. However, the particular issues you would see with the <b>Trading: Profit/Loss Text</b> study  will be based upon the same underlying reasons but show differently. </p>

        <ul>
            <li> The order fills do not exist in the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log &gt;&gt; Trade Activity</b> tab for the particular Symbol and Trade Account the chart is set to. For instructions to use the Trade Activity Log to see the data, refer to  <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Viewing Historical Trade Activity</a>.</li>

            <li>The studies are built from order fills and it is essential to understand how order fills are grouped and matched together.   For complete details, refer to <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#OrderFillMatchingMethods" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Order Fill Matching and Flat to Flat Definition</a>  and <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#TradeStatsOpenQuantityFieldCalculation" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Quantity Field Calculation Method</a>.</li>

            <li>To actually see the individual Trades which consist of an opening fill and a closing fill which are used in the Trade Data  studies, follow the instructions for the <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#TradesTab" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trades tab</a> in the Trade Activity Log. 
            <br> <br>
            Make sure you set the <b>Date Range to Display &gt;&gt; From</b> Date and Time  to the very same Date and Time you see in the  <b>Order Fills Start Date-Time</b> field for the chart in the  <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#TradeStatisticsForChartsTab">Trade Stats for Charts</a> tab, so you get an exact match of the   Trades data used in the chart which are used in these Trade Data studies. This gives you a very good understanding of the data that goes into these studies and to troubleshoot any problems with them.</li>

            <li>The <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#SelectingTradeAccount" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade Account</a> is not set correctly on the Trade Window for the chart.</li>

            <li>Your computer's Date or Time is not set correctly which will cause Trade Data to be misaligned to the chart bars, be delayed before it is displayed, or filtered out completely.

    <h2  id="HowAveragePriceForPositionsIsCalculatedAndUsed">How Average Price for Positions Is Calculated and Used</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#HowAveragePriceForPositionsIsCalculatedAndUsed">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>
    
    <p>In the <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#Introduction">Trade Window</a> for a chart or Trade DOM, the Trade Position Average Price is displayed on the <b>Main</b> and <b>C</b> tabs after the current Trade Position Quantity (refer to image below).</p> 

    <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/tradewindowaverageprice.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/tradewindowaverageprice.png" alt="" class="screenshot" loading="lazy"></a></div>
                
    <p>Additionally, the Trade Position Average Price is displayed on the chart or Trade DOM on the <a href="index3c50.html?page=doc/ChartTrading.html#ViewingOrdersOnTheChart">Position Line</a>  which is displayed at the level of the Average Price. </p> 

    <p>By default, the Average Price for the current open Trade Position is calculated from the order fills stored in the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b> for the particular Symbol and Trade Account the  Position Average price is for. <em>It is the average price of those fills which make up the current Trade Position</em>.</p>
        
    <p>The chart <em>must be set to load all of the order fills</em> which are part of the current Trade Position. Refer to <a href = "#OrderFillsStartDateTimeNeedsToBeSetCorrectly">Order Fills Start Date-Time Needs to Be Set Correctly</a>.</p>

        
    <p>However, there can still be cases where the Trade Position Average Price is not correct as determined from the order fills because of missing or inaccurate order fills.  In newer versions of Sierra Chart, the possibility of this is greatly reduced  due to the fact that a reverse iteration is used to determine   those order fills that make up the current  Position.</p>

    <p>In the case though where the Trade Position Average Price cannot be determined, either there is an incorrect Trade Position Average Price displayed,  or if Sierra Chart knows it cannot  calculate it, then the <a href="#TradeServiceProvidedAveragePrice">Trade Service Provided Average Price</a> is displayed instead for the Symbol and Trade Account.</p>

    <p>The <b>Trade Service Provided Average Price</b> is <em>only for non-simulated Trade Positions</em>. For more information, refer to <a href="#TradeServiceProvidedAveragePrice">Trade Service Provided Average Price</a>.</p>

    <p>The Average Price for  <em>simulated</em> Trade Positions can always be accurately determined. </p> 

    <p>In order for Sierra Chart to be able to properly calculate the Average Price from the order fills, it needs to have the order fills far back enough in time to include the earliest fill which is part of any current Trade Position that you have.</p>

    <p>There are several Average Price  calculation methods for the current Trade Position for a  Symbol  and Trade Account which can be used in a  Chart or a Trading  DOM, that you can use. </p>
        
    <p>One of these can be chosen through  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings </b> <b> &gt;&gt; Open Position Average Price</b>.  They are as follows.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Use Last In First Out Fill Matching for Open Position Average Price</b></li>

        <li><b>Use First In First Out Fill Matching for Open Position Average Price</b></li>

        <li><b>Use Flat to Flat Open Position Average Price</b></li>

        <li><b>Use Last In First Out Fill Matching for Open Position Average Price and For Daily Profit/Loss (Less  reliable since it relies upon a correct  <b>Order Fills Start Date-Time</b>  set in the  Chart Settings and properly aligned to the start of a Position and that there are  no missing  order fills since that Date-Time.)</b></li>
            
        <li><b>Use External Service Open Position Average Price</b></li>

        <li><b>Use Theoretical Position Average Price</b></li>            
    </ul>
        
    <p>The first four  calculations use the order fills that Sierra Chart has which make up the current Trade Position. Each chart  that is used for trading maintains its own Trades list which is used for various Trade Profit/Loss, Trade Statistics and Trade Position Average Price calculations. The Trade Position Average Price calculations are performed within this Trades list.</p>

    <p>The first three calculation methods use a reliable reverse iteration of the order fills for the calculation.</p>
        
    <p>Each of the calculation methods is documented below. </p>

        <p>This Trade Position Average Price calculation method  calculates the average position price for the order fills that make up the current Position by using a  <em>last in first out</em> order fill matching method. The order fills are determined by a reliable reverse iteration.</p>
        
        <p>This method cannot work if there are any missing order fills which make up the current Trade Position.</p>

        <p>This  Trade Position Average Price calculation method  calculates the average position price for the order fills that make up the current Position by using a <em>first in first out</em> order fill matching method.  The order fills are determined by a reliable reverse iteration.</p>
        
        <p> What this specifically means is that starting from a flat position, when a position begins whether long or short, and during the life of that position,  as it changes in quantity,  the buy and sell order fills are matched based upon a first in and first out matching method.  The Position Average Price is based upon those remaining order fills which have not been matched. A quantity weighted average price calculation is used. </p>
        
        <p> This method cannot work if there are any missing order fills which make up the current Trade Position.</p>

        <p>It is supported to use an Average Price based within a chart using a Flat to Flat calculation method. </p>
       
        <p>In the case of a  Long position,  the flat to flat average price is the  order quantity weighted average price of the Buy order fills since the beginning of the  Long position.  In the case of a Short position, the flat to flat average price is the order quantity weighted average price of the Sell order fills since the beginning of the Short position.</p>       
        
        <p>The order fills used in the calculation are determined by a reliable reverse iteration.</p> 

        <p>The Flat to Flat Average Price changes as new entry order fills are made. Exit  order fills have no effect until the Trade Position goes to 0. Unlike the other average price calculations, this is  <em>not</em> just an average of the remaining open fills which make up the current Trade Position.</p>

         <p>This Open Position Average Price method is calculated as follows. </p> 
        
         <p>The order fills which make up the current position are iterated  in reverse.</p> 
         
         <p>SumFillPricesTimesQuantity  is calculated as follows:</p> 
          
         <p>For a Buy order fill, the fill price times the fill quantity is added to SumFillPricesTimesQuantity. </p> 
         
         <p>For a Sell  order fill, the fill price times the fill quantity is subtracted from SumFillPricesTimesQuantity.</p>

Normally leave this blank. Or if you still have a problem  with the   Position Average Price being 0 or not correct, then set   <b>Order Fills Start Date-Time </b> to a time which is   <em>at or before</em>  the entry order for the   Trade Position.   It does not need to be set exactly.</p>   
         
         <p>However, make sure that <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt;</b> <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#FilterInitialFillsWhichArePartOfExistingPosition">Filter Initial Fills Which Are Part of Existing Position</a>  is enabled.</p>


        <p>If for some reason, the Trade   Position Average Price  was still not able to be correctly calculated or obtained, like in the case when Sierra Chart does not have  the order fill data for the Symbol and Trade Account to calculate it, then when you are looking at a chart which is in Chart Trade Mode, or a Trade DOM, the current Position Line may not be visible within the current view of prices.  This will be true if the  Trade Position Average  Price is 0.</p>


        <p>You will always still be able to see the current  <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#CurrentTradePosition">Trade Position Quantity</a> displayed on the <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html">Trade Window</a>.</p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#OpenPLCalculation">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>The Open Profit/Loss displayed on the Trade window after <b>P/L</b>: and also displayed on the Position Line on a chart or a Trade DOM, is calculated as follows when it is displayed as <b>Points (P)</b>: <b>OpenProfitLoss = (LastTradePrice -  PositionAveragePrice) * PositionQuantity</b>.</p>

        <p>PositionQuantity will be a positive number in the case of a Long position and will be negative number  in the case of a Short position.</p>

        <p>Refer to the <a href="#HowAveragePriceForPositionsIsCalculatedAndUsed">How Average Price for Positions Is Calculated and Used</a> section for details on how the <b>AveragePositionPrice</b> value is determined.  </p>
        
        <p>You need to understand that there is a small amount of calculation error due to floating-point calculations performed on computers that can exist, and also a slight variation with the <b>AveragePositionPrice</b> could exist when this value is provided by a Trading service, which you may not be able to see due to display rounding.  </p>
        
        <p>Therefore, the final  Profit/Loss result could be slightly off especially when displayed as a <b>Currency Value</b>.  For example, you could see a  profit/loss value at  <em>50.01</em> when the technically correct value is   <em>50.00</em>.</p>

        <p>How do you determine whether the  <a href="#TradeServiceProvidedAveragePrice">Trade Service Provided Position Average Price</a> is being used on the Trade Window for a Chart  or a Trade DOM instead of the  Sierra Chart calculated  Position Average Price based on the order fills?</p>

        <p>If the Position Average Price you see on the Trade Window for a Chart or Trade DOM has the letter <b class="GeneralBackgroundHighlight">E</b> after it, then this is the Trade Service provided Position Average Price. Otherwise, it is the Order Fill calculated Position Average Price. Refer to the image below for an example of this indicator.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#IncorrectlyReportedTradePositionQuantity">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>If you see an incorrectly reported <em>non-simulated Trade Position Quantity</em> in Sierra Chart, then follow these instructions:</p>

    <ol>

        <li>Make sure <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Simulation Mode</b> is <em>disabled/unchecked</em>.</li>

        <li>If you see an incorrectly reported Trade Position Quantity on a chart, Trade DOM, or on the Trade Window for a chart or Trade DOM, then <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#OpeningTradeWindow"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open the Trade Window</a> and make sure <b class="menu_item">Menu/M &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt;  Use Order Fill Calculated Position</b> is <em>disabled/unchecked</em>.
            <br> <br>
            Related to this, make sure the correct Trade Account is selected on the Trade Window for the chart or Trade DOM, refer to <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#SelectingTradeAccount" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selecting Trade Account</a>.
            <br> <br>
            Also related to this, if the Trade Position Quantity is correct but you do not see the Trade Position line displayed on a chart, then <em>Position Average Price</em> may not be correct or within the viewable price range. In this case, refer to <a href="#HowAveragePriceForPositionsIsCalculatedAndUsed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Average Price for Positions Is Calculated and Used</a>.
        </li>

        <li>Go to the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Positions Window</b>
            <br> <br>
            Locate the Trade Position for the <em>Trade Account</em> and <em>Symbol</em> in the list. This window reports the non-simulated Trade Positions as provided by your external Trading service. You must find a match by comparing <em>both the Trade Account and Symbol</em>.
            <br> <br>
            If there is an incorrectly reported Trade Position <b>Quantity</b> on this tab for a particular Trade Account and Symbol, then you will need to contact your Trading service about the <b>Quantity</b> that you see in this list.
            <br> <br>
            If the Trade Position for the Trade Account and Symbol is not listed at all, this means the Trading service is not reporting the Trade Position for the Trade Account and Symbol.
            <br> <br>
            To ensure you have the most up-to-date data  in the  <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Positions Window</b>, select <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt;  Disconnect</b> and <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Connect to Data Feed</b>. However, reconnecting to the server is almost never necessary to update the data on the  Trade Positions window and is not likely to change the Positions data reported, since it is automatically updated.
        </li>

        <li>If you see the correct Trade Position Quantity for the <em>Trade Account</em> and <em>Symbol</em> on the <b>Positions</b> window, however the Symbol does not exactly match the chart or Trade DOM, then this can be a reason why you do not see the Trade Position on the chart or Trade DOM. In the case of Interactive Brokers, only a portion of the leftmost components of the complete symbol need to match.</li>

        <li>If you see an incorrectly reported <b>Open Quantity</b> on the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log &gt;&gt; Chart Stats</b> tab (Trade Statistics for Charts), then <em>this is not unusual</em>  and is common. You will need  to adjust the <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Trading</b> <b> &gt;&gt; Order Fills Start Date-Time</b> in the chart the  Trade Statistics line is for.
            <br> <br>

    <p>When using the Order Fill Calculated Trade Position for an individual chart or Trade DOM, this Trade Position data could be inaccurate.</p>
    
    <p>To reset this data back to 0 for a particular Symbol and Trade Account, requires  setting a start Date-Time for this order fill data loaded into a chart or Trade DOM.</p>
    
    <p>To set a starting Date-Time for the order fills loaded into a chart, refer to <a href="index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#OrderFillsStartDateTime"  Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Order Fills Start Date-Time</a> in <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b>.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ResettingPositionQuantityAndProfitLossAtStartOfTradingDay">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>This section explains how to  have the Position Quantity  and the Open position  Profit/Loss to reset to 0 at the start of a trading day whether  this is the start of the evening trading session or the start of the  Day trading session  (regular trading hours). It can be either.  </p>
    
    
    
    <p> To accomplish this, you first need to enable the   <a href = "#OrderFillCalculatedPosition">Order Fill Calculated Position</a> for the charts or Trading DOMs where you want to have the position reset  at the start of the  trading day. </p>


    <p> Once this is done, then what you need to do at the beginning of the trading day  whenever you want that to be,   set the  Date part of the <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#OrderFillsStartDateTime">Order Fills Start Date-Time</a> to the current date.   And set the Time  to the time which is the beginning of the trading day. </p>


    <p>  The Position Quantity will go to 0 and the profit/loss will also go to zero. </p>
