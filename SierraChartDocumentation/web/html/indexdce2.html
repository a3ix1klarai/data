    <h2>Log of Changes and Improvements to Sierra Chart</h2>
    
    <p>This list contains major items of development, items which are notable, and changes and additions which users need to be informed about.</p>
    
    <p>This is not a comprehensive changes and additions log. It only represents <em>less than 25% of the actual development</em>  performed every day. There are <em>not</em> version notes for each version. The main Sierra Chart documentation is updated as needed relating to the changes and additions.</p>

    <p>In addition to the below listed items for each version, there are also various low-level improvements, issues resolved, and small additions that a release has which are not listed.</p>

    <ul class="NewListing">
        <li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1781>1781 Release Date: 2018-07-11</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1781">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
        <li>Resolved a problem from a recent release when there are non-simulated  Trade Positions  for more than one Trade Account at the same time for the same symbol, these Positions were being reported under one account and not separately.   It is essential to update to this version or higher  if you are actively using more than one  non-simulated trading  account at the same time. This issue arose  with lower level development with the tracking of Positions.</li>
</ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1778>1778 Release Date: 2018-07-05</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1778">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
        <li>Support for the old Renko chart studies has been permanently discontinued. At this point we are declining all further support for them. You should use the <b>Bar Period Type &gt;&gt; Renko Bar</b> setting in <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b> instead. If you want to use the older Renko studies you can but existing instances will no longer appear on the chart but they can be manually added through <b class="menu_item">Analysis &gt;&gt; Add Custom Study &gt;&gt; Sierra Chart Custom Studies  and Examples</b>. They are listed as Renko Chart and Renko Chart Enhanced. If you have any difficulties, you can provide your Chartbook through the Support Board and we will make the necessary change to make these studies visible in your Chartbook again.</li>
  
        <li>Support has been removed for CQG server-side bracket orders.  Server-side OCO orders are still supported with CQG.  There have been too many associated issues with CQG server-side bracket orders and we are no longer willing to support them as they cause problems for users and create a poor impression of Sierra Chart when the issue is not even on our side to begin with.</li>
      
        <li>Corrected a problem where under a certain set of conditions the title bar of chart windows was not being set with the descriptive text. This can also be resolved by unchecking  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Settings &gt;&gt; GUI &gt;&gt; Application GUI &gt;&gt; Destroy Chart Windows when Hidden</b>.</li>
  
        <li>Fixed a problem with Numbers Bars Calculated Values Gridlines not displaying by default on an existing study after an update to the latest version. This will not fix the problem for anyone that has already upgraded, in this case, you just have to manually set the Subgraphs you do not want to Ignore, and then turn the Gridlines Subgraph to Visible.</li>
      
        <li>Completed development of the futures Trading evaluator service. At this time this will only be tested by some selected trading evaluators. It is not available at this time for general use until we have approval from the CME for the lower-priced exchange fees for it.  There is no guarantee this will happen though. We do look forward to being able to offer the service because it will remove the need for CTS or Rithmic for futures trading evaluation. We now have our own fully integrated and standalone solution.  This greatly simplifies the service  for evaluating futures trading performance  and provides a totally reliable and consistent solution. The concept of connection problems and trading issues, are completely eliminated. </li>

        <h3 id=SCVer1776>1776 Release Date: 2018-07-02</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1776">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
        <li>Added 4 new subgraphs to the Numbers Bars Calculated Values study - Average Bid Volume Per Trade; Average Ask Volume per Trade; Bid Volume per Second; and Ask Volume per Second.</li>

        <li>Corrected a problem from a recent release  where the High/Low/Last  During Position  fields were not being set for non-simulated positions.  This would affect the maximum open position profit and loss calculations in the Trade Activity Log.</li>

        <li>Added new ACSIL functions to get and set study Inputs in any chart including  the chart the calling study is located on.</li>
 
        <li>Added several new options to the  DTC Service Client to skip  the use of the logon message, skip the encoding request, enable relay server mode and enable JSON message logging.</li>
  
        <li>Resolved some issues with Bid & Ask Depth Bars study related to Bid and Ask prices. Bid and Ask prices are now obtained from each chart bar.</li>
 
        <li>Solved an issue with new line characters not being added to the saved message log, which arose in a recent release.</li>
        <li>When using the <b>Add Additional Symbol</b> study  with Intraday charts, a deadlock condition can occur where Sierra Chart completely freezes.  This issue is now resolved.   This was caused by critical sections by different threads being entered in an inconsistent order.</li>

        <ul>
       <li> Separated TPO Profile Input for <b>Highlight TPO Value Area and POC</b> into two  Inputs: <b>Highlight TPO Value Area</b> and <b>Highlight TPO POC</b>.</li>
       
        <li> Added new Input option for Numbers Bars - <b>Ignore 0 Values for Minimum Highlight</b> that will display highlights of the Minimum value that is not 0. </li>

		<li>Numbers Bars performance improvements.</li>
        <li>When using Split profiles with Numbers Bars, Ask or Bid Volumes of 0 will not display a volume bar.  </li>

        <li>Added option for whether to draw text at the beginning or end of the following drawing types: Line, Arrow, Calculator, Zig Zag.</li>
        
        <li>For TPO profiles,  when these letters/blocks are set to be displayed in individual columns, then when using the Chart Values tool the actual Date-Time of each of those columns will be displayed in the Chart Values windows and on the time scale. </li>

        <li> Numbers Bars performance improvements. </li>

        <ul>
       <li>Corrected the issue from the prior release where there was a detrimental performance impact for ACSIL studies using  Volume at Price data.  There is now no longer any detrimental performance impact. </li>

        <ul>
       <li>Forward Curve study added. This allows for up to 5 dates to be specified as days back from today, and the curves are drawn for a specified period of months in the future from those dates. </li>
        <li> Added new option to the   <b>TPO Letter/Block Colors</b>  Input with the TPO Profile Chart study to support coloring the day and evening session letters or blocks  separately in TPO profiles. </li>

      <li>Additional   performance improvements with Volume Profiles and TPO Profiles.   The previous performance improvements in some cases made  performance worse under certain cases. All of these cases have now been optimized and overall there is much higher performance now.   Performance with chart data loading should also be improved when using  studies which require volume at price data. 
      <br> <br>
      As a result of these performance improvements, any ASCIL custom study which uses  <b>sc.VolumeAtPriceForBars</b>  must be recompiled for this version or higher because otherwise, they  may perform poorly or less optimally due to the changes.  So recompiling is important to do for those custom studies on this version or higher.  <em>Note: We have determined a solution to this problem and it will be implemented in version 1765  which will be out before 2018-06-16.  Therefore, recompiling will no longer be necessary.</em></li>

    <li>Up to 20 Graphics Settings configurations can be saved and loaded to allow changing between color schemes very quickly.</li>
    <li>Corrected a problem  from a recent release where when duplicating   a chart which uses its own individual  Graphics Settings, the settings  were not copied to the new chart. </li>

    <li>The General Trade Settings option <b>HoldLimitAttachedOrdersOnClientSideUntilTouched</b> has been removed as it is no longer necessary now that there is the  <b>Limit if Touched - Client</b> order which effectively does the same thing. This is what is recommended to be used as the alternative. If there is any functionality which you cannot accomplish now that this option has been removed, let us know and we will see how best to implement this.</li>

    <li>Corrected a problem  with chart replay when jumping forward   By Number of Trades or To Next  Bar, where the replay would continue until the end immediately. This is resolved.</li>
    
    <li>Added Subgraph for <b>Count of Alerts</b> to the Volume at Price Threshold Alert v2 study that contains the count of the alerts per bar.</li>

    <li>Corrected an issue from a recent release where when  Historical Daily data needs to be downloaded from a source other than the Sierra Chart Historical  Data Service, that was not happening and instead the data was being downloaded from the  Sierra Chart Historical Data service.

    <li>Added <b>Cumulative Delta Up/Down Tick Volume</b> Subgraph to Numbers Bars Calculated Values.</li>

    <li>  Added new Time in Force setting for trading to send an order at a specified time. This is on the Trade Window and is named  <b>Send Order at Time</b>.</li>

    <li>Corrected an Attached Order quantity problem when the attached orders  cannot have all the same quantities as the parent order quantity. Due to the recent change to support fractional quantities, the attached orders were getting set as  fractional when the parent order quantity is changed and they cannot all have the same quantity. This is now corrected.</li>

    <li>  Feature to submit spread orders independent of exchange traded spreads.   This supports up to  four different symbols.   This feature is accessible through   <b>A</b> tab of the Trade Window.    Press the  <b>Enter Spread Order </b> button to  add the   Spread Order Entry study and open the Input settings for configuration. Documentation will follow shortly.

    <li>In Simple Alert Formulas when using the subgraphs SG22 and SG23  which refer to the Renko Open and Renko Close values,  when the chart bars are not Renko, these will refer to the true Open and Close values respectively and not cause a formula error.</li>
    <li> Improvements to the  feature to Flatten and Cancel orders   at a  set time on the   Trade   Window.    Previously a confirmation would be shown  at the time the  Position is flattened, and this is no longer the case.    The confirmation should not have been displayed.   Anytime the time value is changed, it will reset the  trigger date.      Previously  Flatten and Cancel action would only be allowed to occur once a day.
