    <p>The DTC Protocol Server in Sierra Chart can be used by another instance of Sierra Chart either on the same computer or across a network. <em>Although market data is only allowed to be used on the same computer</em>.</p>

    <p>The DTC Protocol Server allows the sharing of the market data and trading functionality of the server instance of Sierra Chart to other instances of Sierra Chart. These other instances are referred to as the <em>client</em> instances. This DTC Server supports both market data and trading.</p>
    
     <p>  Although the sharing of market data across a network is prohibited  in order to maintain compliance with market data rules. </p>
    
    <p> The instructions on this page are for sharing the market data and trading functionality from one instance of Sierra Chart with another instance.  </p>
    
    <p> If you want to use multiple copies of Sierra Chart with <em>different</em> Data and Trading services, then refer to the  <a href="index6ebd.html?page=doc/MultipleServices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Multiple Data and Trading services</a> page <em>instead</em> of the instructions on this page below. That page also explains how to share market data between instances of Sierra Chart that use  <em>different  Trading services</em>.</p>
    
    <p>One reason to use additional instance of Sierra Chart is to distribute processing load among instances which run as independent processes which can utilize additional CPU cores for study calculations for example.</p>

        <li>Start another instance of Sierra Chart by selecting  <b Class = "menu_item">File &gt;&gt; New Instance</b> in an existing running instance of Sierra Chart. This can only be done from the main instance of Sierra Chart, not a sub-instance.</li>
          
          
        <li> To automatically start new instances of Sierra Chart on startup of the main instance, the instance numbers can be  specified as a comma separated list in <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Settings &gt;&gt; Instances to Run on Startup</b>. For example, you can enter a <b><em>2</em></b> in that edit box to automatically start a second instance. Or enter  <b><em>2, 3</em></b> to start a second and third instance automatically.</li>
        
        <li>When using <b Class = "menu_item">File &gt;&gt; New Instance</b>, a new instance is automatically updated to the same version as the main instance of Sierra Chart.</li>
        
        <li> Each instance of Sierra Chart maintains its own copy of global settings, Chartbooks and  chart data files. The first time a new instance is created,  it receives a copy of the global settings and Chartbooks from the main instance.
        </li>


        <li> To open a chart which will be fed by the DTC Server from the  main instance of Sierra Chart,  select <b  Class = "menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Find Symbol</b> in the new instance of Sierra Chart. </li>

        <li>The <b>Find Symbol</b> list will initially be <em>empty</em> because the Symbol Settings have to be requested. Wait a moment for them to be received and then the list will fill in. 
         <br> <br>
        If this does not occur within about 5 to 20 seconds, then follow the procedure to perform an  <a href="index4404.html?page=doc/GlobalSymbolSettings.php#UpdateSettings" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Update of the Symbol  Settings</a> to get them. It is necessary to have the proper Symbol Settings in an instance of Sierra Chart which is connected to the DTC Server of another instance. </li>

        <p>All historical Intraday and Daily data for a Symbol in an instance of Sierra Chart started using New Instance, is downloaded from the existing Intraday or Daily chart data file in the Main Instance if the file exists. </p>

        <p>If the file exists, but it is not up to date with the current data, then the current data will be downloaded into the file first before the data is served to client instances of Sierra Chart.</p>

        <p>If a chart data file does not exist in the Main Instance, then the data will be first automatically downloaded for that Symbol and chart data type from the connected Data or Trading service the Main Instance is set to use. When this historical data download is done, then the data is served to client instances of Sierra Chart.</p>

        <p>If there is any  missing or incorrect Historical Daily or Intraday chart data in the client instance of Sierra Chart which is connected to the Main Instance, then go to the the <em>main instance</em> of  where you  selected <b Class = "menu_item">File &gt;&gt; New Instance</b>) and open the same type of chart (Historical or Intraday) for the same Symbol and correct any missing or incorrect data issues there <em>first</em>.</p>

        <p>To avoid this issue only adjust the order from the instance it was initiated in.  </p>

        <p> Related to this is that since the parent order is split up into multiple orders, when you cancel one of these  parent orders in an instance other  than where  the orders were originally entered from, you will have to cancel each order individually and get multiple order confirmations. </p>

        <p>   A similar case is true of the  order association lines between Target and Stop  order. You will only see these lines in the instance where the orders  were entered from. You will not see them in other instances.   The information necessary for these lines only exists in the instance where the   orders were submitted from.  However, you will see the order association lines in the   main/server instance of Sierra Chart.  Since it is aware    the Target  and Stop orders are in  an OCO group.  </p>

        <p>Normally only <em>one instance</em> of Sierra Chart that you are running on the same computer should be set to be a DTC Server and have the   <b>DTC Protocol Server</b> enabled.  </p>
        
        <p>If other instances of Sierra Chart which are running your computer system  at the same time  also have the  <b>DTC Protocol Server</b> enabled  (<b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Sierra Chart Server Settings &gt;&gt; DTC Protocol Server &gt;&gt;  Enable DTC Protocol Server = Yes</b>, you need to make sure there are not port number conflicts. In other words, they need to be using different port numbers.</p>
        
        <p>Client instances of Sierra Chart which connect to a DTC Server instance of Sierra Chart must have the  <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt;  Sierra Chart Server Settings &gt;&gt; DTC Protocol Server &gt;&gt; Enable DTC Protocol Server</b> option <em>disabled</em> to avoid port number conflicts.  </p>
        
        <p>Once you have disabled this option, you should not have to continue with the further instructions.   Unless more than one instance of Sierra Chart is running as a server on the same computer.</p>

        <p> Below is an example of what you will see in the Message Log indicating a port number conflict. </p>


        <div class="MessageLog">
            <p>DTC Protocol Server failed to start listening on port 11099.</p>

            <p>Listening socket (1740), port 0 | Closed.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Follow through the below steps to resolve port number conflicts for each installation of Sierra Chart that you have running.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Exit from any sub instances of Sierra Chart, started with  <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; New Instance</b>.</li>
            
            <li>Go to one of the instances of Sierra Chart you have running on your system and select <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt;  Sierra Chart Server Settings &gt;&gt; DTC Protocol Server</b>.</li>

            <li>Make sure the <b> Enable DTC Protocol Server</b> option is enabled and make a note of the <b>Listening Port</b> and <b>Historical Data Port</b> numbers.</li>

            <li>Press <b>OK</b>.</li>

            <li>Go to the next instance of Sierra Chart on your system and select    <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt;  Sierra Chart Server Settings &gt;&gt; DTC Protocol Server</b>.</li>

            <li> Either <em>uncheck</em> the <b>Enable DTC Protocol Server</b>  option or set the  <b>Listening Port</b> and <b>Historical Data Port</b> numbers to different port numbers than what are currently used in other instances of Sierra Chart. You can use any port numbers. They should be in the range of 10000 through 60000.
            <br> <br>
            Make sure you are not using a port already in use on your system or used by another instance of Sierra Chart. You can determine what ports are in use through the  <b>netstat</b> program. Commandline:  <em>netstat -a -b</em>.
             <br> <br>
            Unless these other instances of Sierra Chart should be functioning as a DTC server,  which is unlikely in most cases, then <em>uncheck</em> <b>Enable DTC Protocol Server</b>.
            </li>

            <li>  In the case of an instance of Sierra Chart started with <b Class = "menu_item">File &gt;&gt; New Instance</b> and where the   <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Data/Trade Service Settings</b> <b> &gt;&gt; Service</b> in that instance is set to <b>DTC - Sub Instance</b>, then you must uncheck the <b>Enable DTC Protocol Server</b> option. </li>

    <p>When a  sub   instance is started for the first time, a new Sierra Chart installation is created within a subfolder within the main Sierra Chart installation folder (<b>C:\SierraChart</b> by default). The name of the folder is <b>SierraChartInstance_#</b> where # is the instance number.  The instance numbers start at 2 and go up depending upon how many sub instances were simultaneously  running. </p>

    <p> A complete copy of the main Sierra Chart installation folder is made except for Intraday and Daily chart data files, and the internal order ID file. These do not need to be copied to the sub instance folder.</p>
     
    <p>You are able to completely delete the sub instance folder when the sub instance is not currently running. After you do this a complete copy of the main Sierra Chart installation folder is made except for Intraday and Daily chart data files, and the internal order ID file, when the new instance is started again with <b class = "menu_item">File &gt;&gt; New Instance</b>. </p>

    <p>This lets you fully reinitialize the sub instance completely. However, keep in mind any Chartbook files you previously created  in the sub instance would be lost if you do this. So make a backup of those first. </p>
    
    <p> You also have the ability to manually copy Chartbooks  (<b>Cht</b> file extension) from the main instance Data folder to the sub instance Data folder. Do this through the operating system file manager. Refer to <a href="#CopyingFilesBetweenInstances">Copying Files Between Instances</a>.  This would be  good to do if you want to copy newly created Chartbooks to the sub instance.</p>
      
    <p> If you do not want to use the sub instance any longer or just want to delete all of the files for whatever reason, the entire <b>SierraChartInstance_#</b>  subfolder in the Sierra Chart installation folder can be deleted through your operating system file manager. After this, check the <a href="index899f.html?page=doc/GeneralSettings.html#InstancesToOpenOnStartup">Instances To Open On Startup</a>  setting to make sure the instance number is not automatically started when you start Sierra Chart.</p>

    <p> When starting a new sub instance of Sierra Chart (<b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; New Instance</b>), and that sub instance was never started before, that sub instance is initialized with the global configuration from the main instance, and all of the Chartbooks  from the main instance of Sierra Chart.</p>
    
    <p>  After this initialization as described above, the sub instance  is fully independent from the main instance. Any changes to the Global settings, or Chartbooks are only within that particular instance.  There is no synchronization between instances supported. </p>
     
    <p>The particular sub instance you are working in can be identified by the number after the #  on the title bar of the main window. </p>
     
    <p>  After starting a sub instance for the first time, if you later want to copy  Chartbook files between the main instance  and the sub instance this has to be done manually.   Otherwise, there is no synchronization of Chartbooks between instances.</p>


    <p>For example, you cannot save a Chartbook in the main instance and have it accessible in the sub instance.   Chartbook files can be copied between   Sierra Chart instances through your operating system file manager. These Chartbook files  (.Cht file extension) are contained within  the  <a href = "index899f.html?page=doc/GeneralSettings.html#DataFilesFolder">Data Files Folder</a> of each instance of Sierra Chart and can be easily copied between data folders. However,  they should only be copied after they have been  <a href = "index7674.html?page=doc/Chartbooks.html#SaveChartbook">saved</a> to ensure they have the latest changes made to a Chartbook.</p>

    <p>Simply copy the files you want from the  main instance  to the corresponding sub  instances.  Overwrite them in the destination if necessary.  You can copy files in either direction. From the main instance to a sub instance or from a sub instance to the main instance.</p>    

    <p> The  sub instance  installation folders, are located in the main instance folder with the name   <em><b>\SierraChartInstance_#</b></em> where # is the instance number. The main instance folder is usually  <em><b>C:\SierraChart</b></em>.</p>

    <p>This is in addition to the   <a href = "indexc0b8.html?page=doc/Features.php#Performance">multithreaded functionality</a> Sierra Chart already has in other areas of the program.</p>

    <p> There is no additional resource usage, when  using additional  instances, since the basic  core Sierra Chart program  does not itself use any CPU usage and the memory usage is very low. It is only when  Charts, Trading DOMs, Spreadsheets, Quote Boards  are open or other functionality is being used, is where the CPU load comes from. </p>
    
     <p>In the case of when viewing the same symbol within different installed instances of Sierra Chart, there is a separate  chart data storage for each instance of Sierra Chart but this does not add to CPU usage.  It only increases storage space requirements, but the data is compressed and with large storage drives, this usually is of no consequence.  And this also has the advantage of being able to have a sub instance use  a higher  <b>Intraday  Data Storage Time Unit</b>.  </p>
