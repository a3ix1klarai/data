    <h2>Log of Changes and Improvements to Sierra Chart</h2>
    
    <p>This list contains major items of development, items which are notable, and changes and additions which users need to be informed about.</p>
    
    <p>This is not a comprehensive changes and additions log. It only represents <em>less than 25% of the actual development</em>  performed every day. There are <em>not</em> version notes for each version. The main Sierra Chart documentation is updated as needed relating to the changes and additions.</p>

    <p>In addition to the below listed items for each version, there are also various low-level improvements, issues resolved, and small additions that a release has which are not listed.</p>

    <ul class="NewListing">
        <li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1906>1906 Release Date: 2019-04-18</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1906">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>

    <li>  Corrected a scenario where there could be an unexpected reset of the Recent Bid Volume and Ask Volume for a price level. An explanation of the basic scenario is where when the market has traded on the bid side at a particular price and stays there without any further trading  for an extended time like 30 seconds, then the market trades at the next higher price and then back to the prior price within a single second, when it trades back to the prior price on the bid side, the  Recent Bid  Volume would have been reset because there was no trading therefore  31 seconds.  This is resolved in version 1906.</li>
 
    <li>Corrected a problem where when historical market depth  data files are loaded in a chart like when using the Market Depth  Historical Graph study, there can be a scenario where there is a continuous  reading of the most recent data  in the latest file loaded causing an endless loop.   This is not a common scenario but sometimes it has been reported to occur around the market opening.  This is now resolved.</li>
 
    <li>Continued improvements with New Chartbook and main window child tabs.</li>
</ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1903>1903 Release Date: 2019-04-17</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1903">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>

    <li>A future intersection line  can now always be set to extend to the end of the chart and can also be a transparent drawn range rather than just a single line. This is supported by the  <b>Volume at Price Threshold  Alert V2</b> study and by the ACSIL function:
sc.AddLineUntilFutureIntersectionEx(const n_ACSIL::s_LineUntilFutureIntersection& LineUntilFutureIntersection).</li>

    <li>New Chartbook and main window child tabs. There are still some outstanding issues with this new feature that will be resolved in the next release.</li>

    <li>Corrected a problem from version 1898 with the Trade Activity Log where when a chart initiates a trade activity clear operation for the Symbol and Trade Account of the chart,  the chart will get notified. This should not happen. This should not cause a problem but should not occur either.</li>
</ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1898>1898 Release Date: 2019-04-10</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1898">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>

    <li>Corrected an issue with the new Trade Activity Log where the trade activity will log itself would not update after a clear  operation initiated from a chart.</li>

    <li>Implemented resolution to a scenario  where a delayed order modification quantity was not being used  by a trail order modification which  could result in an Attached Order not being increased from multiple parent fills to the full parent order quantity.</li>

    <li>Delayed  order modifications are now immediately performed as soon as the prior pending   operation on the order has completed.</li>

    <li>Corrected an issue from a recent release where the Position Average Price incrementally calculated from external service  order fills, was not accurate upon a reconnection to the data feed.  This affected the CQG trading service.</li>
    
     <li>  Implemented support for a backup server in the Service Settings for the  Sierra Chart Order Routing Service.   If you are using this service, set <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Data/Trade Service Settings &gt;&gt; Service Setting  &gt;&gt; Backup Server</b> to  <b>Server 4</b>. </li>
</ul>

        <h3 id=SCVer1892>1892 Release Date: 2019-03-29</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1892">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>

    <li>Updated Volume by Price study to allow the adjustment of the Width values for the outlines. This affects all Drawing Methods and is controlled separately for Primary and Evening sessions.</li>

    <li>Added <b>HL Volatility</b> study.</li>

    <li>Added option for how to display Percentages (as 2 decimal places with percent sign, or using Value Format setting) in the Numbers Bars Calculated Values studies.</li>

    
    <li>Added support for using additional order types from ACSIL including using them as Attached  Orders.</li>
    
    <li>New TPO Profile Chart calculations displayed in the Chart Values Windows.</li>
    
    <li>Trade Activity Log performance improvements. Refer  to <a href = "https://www.sierrachart.com/SupportBoard.php?ThreadID=41265">this support board thread</a> for further details.   To view data on the   <b>Statistics, Trades, Period Stats</b> tabs, it is necessary to first select the  <b>Trade Activity</b> tab from the menu at the top.  In the list box at the top left, select either  <b>Fills</b> or   <b> All Activity</b> to display the fills on the   <b>Trade Activity</b> tab and then press the  <b>Apply</b> button.  If there are no fills displayed on the <b> Trade Activity</b>  tabs, then  the <b>Statistics, Trades, Period Stats</b> tabs will display zeros or be blank.</li>
      
    <li>Keyboard shortcut and control bar button support for Flatten Only and Send Attached Orders by Position.</li>
    <li>  Support   for the new  <a href = "index6880.html?page=doc/SierraChartOrderRoutingServiceWithData.php">Sierra Chart Order Routing Service</a>. </li>
      
      <li> Various other lower level development. </li>
</ul>

    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1881>1881 Release Date: 2019-03-04</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1881">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>

    <li>Implemented order fill filtering for the Trades list used by the Trade Statistics, Trades and Period Stats tabs of the Trade Activity Log,   so the first fill loaded is aligned to the beginning of a new position to generate consistently accurate trading statistics. This only applies to simulated trading, the Sierra Chart futures order routing service, and the Sierra Chart simulated futures trading service.</li>

    <li>Updated <b>Percent Change Since Open</b> study to set the default of the <b>Multiplier</b> input to 100. When this value is set to 100, the display of the data is in proper percentage difference format.</li>

    <li>Updated <b>Percent Change Since Previous Close</b> study to multiply the data by 100. This allows the display of the data to be in proper percentage difference format.</li> 

    <li>Improvements related to filling orders from estimated position in queue  to ensure there are no unexpected conditions for filling an order and to ensure there is no negative queue position.</li>

    <li>Updated the coloring methodology for the  <b>Market Depth Historical Graph</b> so the full range of each color will be used and each color will use the Minimum Volume Intensity Percent within its own range.</li>

    <li> Corrected an issue from a recent prerelease with the main instance of Sierra Chart freezing under certain conditions when running a sub instance related to the sending of trade orders to the sub instance.</li>

    <li>Added new display options for <b>Trading: Profit/Loss Text</b> study.</li>

    <li>New ACSIL function sc.EvaluateGivenAlertConditionFormulaAsBoolean to evaluate a given alert formula. </li>
    
    <li> Corrected a problem  from a significantly older version where the reading  of the old chart drawing data structure  in a Chartbook  from versions dating back earlier than March 2017 was not being skipped over properly preventing the Chartbook from being fully read.  When opening an old Chartbook from versions earlier than approximately version 1531,  chart drawings will not be read.  Update to this version, to be able to open Chartbooks from versions earlier than version 1531.
    
    <br> <br>  
   And to be able to get the chart drawings also loaded with the Chartbook, the solution is to install version 1531   and open the older version Chartbook, save the Chartbook and then the Chartbook can be opened in version 1877 and higher.

    <li>Corrected a problem affecting versions 1870 through 1874 which could after a certain period of time because a deadlock in Sierra Chart causing it to freeze with 0% CPU usage.</li>
    
    <li>Implemented  initial order fill filtering for the  Trades list in a chart  (which is used for calculations like the Daily Profit/Loss, trade statistics, Position quantity for simulated trading,   historical order fill  display on the chart,  and other related values),   where the first fill loaded must be at the start of a new  Position. Otherwise, the fill will be filtered.  This ensures that the  Position quantity value which is generated from the Trades list, and the trade statistics are properly aligned to the start of a new  Position in order to provide consistently accurate values. However, this feature can only work reliably for simulated trading  (when   <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Simulation Mode On</b> is enabled, the  Futures Trading Evaluator service, and the new upcoming Sierra Chart order routing service.  It cannot work reliably with any other external trading service.  Also it can only work for order fills processed for these particular services and Trade Simulation Mode, effective with this version and higher.  Update:  This functionality needs additional work and will be fully implemented in version 1876.</li>

    <li>Greatly improved  Custom study DLL management. There will no longer be permission denied errors  when using external build tools. There is no longer a need to use:  sc.FreeDLL.   There are new commands on  <b class="menu_item">Analysis &gt;&gt; Build Custom Studies DLL &gt;&gt; Build</b> to release all DLLs and to allow the loading again  to support using external custom study build tools. These changes were necessary to maintain high performance with custom studies by not automatically loading and releasing the DLL at every study calculation and also eliminated a memory leak which exists on Windows 10  in some cases related to this. Instead a DLL is only released and reloaded as necessary to allow changes to the DLL executable.</li>

    <li>Corrected a problem with the  move stop to breakeven reference price when using a single  stop order and scaling in, where the reference price would not change significantly from the original parent order price.  This issue arose after correcting an issue with the move to breakeven reference price calculation when there are multiple linked stop orders.</li>

For further information, refer to this   <a href = "https://www.sierrachart.com/SupportBoard.php?ThreadID=37736">support board  thread</a>. An alternative  superior solution is in development and should be out no later than the middle of November 2018. If you use remote chart data files,   you should not update to the newer versions of Sierra_Chart until this alternative functionality is out. If you do, the remote chart data file functionality   will not work and the chart data file will instead be referenced from the  Data folder of the instance the chart is in.</li>

        <li>Added new study - Moving Average - Block.</li>

        <li>Corrected a problem where when a Realtime Price Multiplier is required for the symbol, for example in the case of CTS, and there is more than one OCO group used with Attached Orders, the price calculation  for Attached Orders for OCO Groups after 1 was based on an incorrect price adjustment. This arose  in a recent release related to the recent trading optimizations being done.</li>

        <li>Corrected various small graphics related issues related to the recent graphics development.</li>

        <ul>
        <li>Definitively resolved  the exception problem encountered in some cases when using  the Spreadsheet study in recent versions. The problem was due to some small references being made to an object that was believed to be in a fixed location in memory, but that was not the case.</li>
 
        <li> Added websocket server capability to the    DTC server in Sierra Chart. This allows it  to be easily used by web browsers and languages like JavaScript.  There is automatic detection of a websocket and the encoding is JSON Compact when using a websocket. </li>
        
        <li> Changes to Drawing Tool Configuration/Properties dialogs to improve interface. Changes are ongoing and not yet finalized.</li>

        <ul>
        <li>Corrected a problem from the recent trading development, where when using an OCO order type where each order in the OCO group, has its own Attached Orders,   when one side of the OCO order  filled or was canceled, the other side was not getting canceled. This is  now resolved.</li>
 
        <li> Reverted recent  Spreadsheet development improvements due to an exception problem experienced by some users and would apparently also lead to  Spreadsheet formula cells clearing unexpectedly.  100% stability and perfection in Sierra Chart is critical to us, and this kind of problem is not acceptable and we do apologize for the issue  and we are working hard on determining what the underlying cause is.  If there are any further issues, do let us know so we can be aware of them and resolve them.  Unfortunately none of these issues have shown up in any testing before the release and subsequent to that.   Based on reports from users, version 1781 does not have these described issues. </li>
 
        <li> Various other lower level development and improvements. </li>

        <ul>
        <li>Continued trading related performance improvements. These performance improvements are a major step forward for Sierra Chart  to support high-performance  trading for both small and large scale trading (thousands of orders a second). Initial testing shows that order submission from the chart out to the network  takes less than 20 microseconds.</li>
 
        <li>When there are multiple target orders and   multiple linked stops at the same price, the move to breakeven calculation  during a Scale In operation previously was only considering the quantity of the stop order which had its order quantity increased. Now it considers the  order quantity of all of  the linked stop orders, for a more precise move to breakeven calculation.</li>
 
        <li> Added new setting to <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt;  Symbol Settings</b> to specify the global Trade Position Quantity Limit. </li>
        
        <li>Lower-level graphics improvements and issues resolved related to recent graphics development. </li>
        
        <li>Added new Trading: Position Average Price study.</li>
         
        <li>Corrected some minor issues with the Add Additional Symbol study.</li>
          
        <li>General performance improvements.</li>
        
        <li>A significant amount of trading related development has been done on this version  and some testing has been completed and has all passed  but more testing will be done. While we do not expect any issues, it is recommended to perform live trading only on the current release  and not this particular prerelease, at this time. </li>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1789">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
        <li>New Text Color input for Large Volume Trade Indicator study to control the color of the text that is drawn with the study.</li>

        <li>New Subgraph called Sum of Alerts within the Color Bar Based on Alert Condition study that sums up the number of true alerts.</li>

        <li>The entire  trading order storage and order look up functionality has been greatly improved performance wise and offers drastically improved performance for large order sets (>=1000).   The performance benefits increase  with the larger the number of orders Sierra Chart is tracking. So if it is tracking thousands or hundreds of thousands of orders, the performance improvement will be significant to major. For less than 100, the performance improvement is negligible.  Additional improvements will be made in the coming weeks.</li>

        <li>Added support for BitMex server-side OCO and Bracket orders.</li>
        <li>Resolved small graphics issues  arising in prior release. </li>

        <ul>
        <li>Updated Renko Bar Predictor study to work properly when being used with Inverse Renko bars.</li>

        <li>Added support for downloading of historical orders fills from the BitMex crypto currency exchange.</li>

        <li>If the symbol settings for a symbol were not available when a chart is opened, when that chart is reloaded they will be  reset to the symbol settings available, to ensure they are correct.</li>

        <li>General low-level trading improvements to support the futures trading evaluator, and general exchange functionality.   There are numerous enhancements currently being worked on  which will further reduce latency with order routing.  It is already very fast for small sets of orders but  for large-scale processing,  in the  thousands of orders, the development we are doing will reduce latency. This development is also used   for applications where Sierra Chart is used for common order routing   with omnibus accounts to handle multiple users.</li>

        <li>Updated Numbers Bars and Color Bar Based on Alert Condition studies to allow control for extension lines Label and Value from the subgraph page.</li>

        <li>Numbers Bars Calculated Values table lines now have the proper formatting in the Chart Values window.</li>

        <li>Graphics code reorganization into a common component to allow porting to other operating systems more easily.  And performance improvements related to this. But the performance benefits at this point are going to be minimal if at all.</li>
         
        <li> Added new execution instruction options for the BitMex trading service.</li>
        <li> Added new Trading Status field for the Quote Board. This is set when using the Sierra Chart Exchange Data Feed and indicates whether the market is open or closed or is in a pre-open status. </li>

        <ul>
        <li> Restored CQG server-side bracket order support. We made a change with one setting related to proportional triggering which may resolve an issue where previously there were multiple order sets being generated on the CQG side when the parent order fills in multiple lots.</li>
         <li> Corrected a problem with the    <b>Send Order at  Time</b>  Time in Force  when used with the Trading  DOM   where the order was not being sent from the Held state when that time was encountered.
        <li>Various other development. </li>

        <ul>
        <li> Added new option in Chart DOM Settings: <b>Recent/Current Volume Bars Length Relative to Bid and Ask</b>. When this option is enabled, the length of the Volume bars in the Recent Bid and Recent Ask DOM Columns is based on the maximum value in either the Recent Bid or Recent Ask columns. The Current Traded Bid Volume and Current Traded Ask Volume work the same way.</li> 

        <li>Rearranged the Chart DOM Settings window due to the number of items available on the window.</li>

        <li>As of this version, with ACSIL it is no longer possible to change the  chart  bar period  using the individual ACSIL members like sc.VolumePerBar. It is now required  to use the  <a href = "indexb9b8.html?page=doc/ACSIL_Members_Functions.html#scSetBarPeriodParameters">sc.SetBarPeriodParameters</a> function.   This change is necessary to properly support  <b>sc.SetBarPeriodParameters</b>.</li>
     
        <li>Corrected a problem when editing a  Trade Activity Log entry where the Symbol was not being set correctly  in the case of a simulated entry and would cause a simulated order fill entry to no longer be displayed on a chart and also the  Value Format would be incorrect.</li>
     
        <li>Finalized the development of the Spread Order Entry study. This can be accessed through the <b>A</b> tab of the Trade Window for the chart. It is recommended that this feature only be used in Trade Simulation Mode until you are certain it works properly for you.</li>
     
        <li>Memory allocation error handling has been added for the Market Depth Historical Graph feature. Previously an out of memory condition would lead to an exception being reported in the Message Log and this could lead to unpredictable behavior, at the very least with the Market Depth Historical Graph study. </li>
        
         <li>Spreadsheet performance improvements. </li>
