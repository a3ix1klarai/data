    <p>Attached Orders are orders which are attached to the main order being submitted. These Attached Orders  function as price Targets and/or Stops. Most any combination of Attached Orders can be specified to be attached to the main order.</p>

    <p>The primary order entered is known as a <em>Parent</em> order and all Attached Orders are known as <em>Child Orders</em> or <em>Attached Orders</em>.</p> 

    <p>The Attached Orders are always the opposite Side compared to the  Parent order. For example, if the   Parent order is a <b>Buy</b> order, all the Attached Orders  associated with it will be <b>Sell</b> orders.</p>

    <p>When there are Stop and Target Attached Orders attached to a Parent order, these orders are in an  Order  Cancels Order (OCO) group.</p>

    <p>A simple example of a Parent order with an attached Stop and Target order is commonly known as a <em>bracket order</em>.</p>

    <p>You can have as little as one Attached Order or many. The relationship between the Attached Orders or Child orders themselves are known as <em>siblings</em>.</p>

    <p>When there are Attached Orders defined and active, on the Trade Window for a chart or Trade DOM, and you enter an order from that Trade Window or from the associated chart or Trade DOM, these Attached Orders will then be attached to the parent order if they are enabled to be used.</p>

        <p>The information in this subsection explains the management of Attached Orders when the Trading service does not support server side OCO orders and server side  Bracket orders. This information also applies to orders entered when Sierra Chart Trade Simulation Mode is on.</p>

        <p><em>When a Parent order is submitted, the Attached Orders remain  inactive and have a Quantity of 0</em>.</p>

        <p>When a parent order is filled, the Attached Orders will become <em>active</em> and at that time are sent to the connected Trading service if Trade Simulation Mode is disabled. Or are processed by the Sierra Chart Trade Simulation system, if Trade Simulation Mode is enabled. </p>

        <p>Therefore, in the case of when Trade Simulation Mode is disabled, if you are trading a symbol which is an exchange listed symbol, then most likely the  Target and Stop orders are now going to be working at the exchange. </p>

        <p>Although potentially the Trading service could be holding them.  This might only be the case in the case of a Stop order.  When using a Sierra Chart intermediary server for order routing,  the Attached Orders are always going to be sent to the exchange without being held on the intermediary server,  after the parent order fills.</p>
        
        
        <p> The Attached Orders will only be submitted to the external trading service, or to the Sierra Chart Trade Simulation system if Trade Simulation Mode is enabled, when  there is a notification of a fill of the parent order. This would be considered a real time notification. The Attached Orders are not sent when there is some historical indication of a fill like   an order status update that is received later on the order after connecting to the  Trading service.   For example, if an order filled  when Sierra Chart is not connected to the Trading service, and there is some historical indication of a fill, then the Attached Orders will not become active on that type of indication.</p>
        
        <p>It is not regarded as safe, to submit Attached Orders other than from a real-time fill notification. Other notifications could be false in some way  based upon experience,  will be delayed, and it may not make sense for the orders to be submitted at that time because the  Position may not exist any longer, the price of the market will have changed, and Attached Orders may not even be at valid prices, and other numerous reasons.   Also in most cases there is not a way for Sierra Chart to know that a parent order filled other than from a real-time notification.  There simply is no definite other way to know  this which is reliable.</p>

        <p>Once the Attached Orders are active, the  quantity of the Attached Orders will be equal to the quantity of the parent order unless there was a partial fill of the parent order in which case the  Attached Orders will have a quantity equal to the filled quantity of the parent order.</p>

        <p>Until the parent fills, the Attached Orders will be <em>inactive and held within Sierra Chart</em>.  They will not be sent to the connected Trading service until there is a fill or partial fill of the parent order.</p>

        <p>When the Attached Orders are held within Sierra Chart in the case when the server does not support server side Bracket orders or the option to use that is disabled, this is indicated in the Trade Activity Log.  In the  <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Trade Activity Log</a>, in the <b>Order Action Source</b> field for the order,  client-side managed Attached Orders will contain the text <b>Client side bracket order</b>. </p>
 

        <p>When the Attached Orders are active and the Limit or Stop price for an Attached Order is reached and one of the orders is fully filled, then the other  Attached Order, if there is one, in the same OCO (Order Cancels Order) group will be  <em>canceled</em> by Sierra Chart.</p>

        <p>Partial fills are managed as well. When the parent order partially fills, the Attached Orders will be activated to the quantity of the parent order fill. Likewise, if there is a partial fill of one of the Attached Orders, then the other Attached Order in the same OCO group will have its quantity adjusted down by the amount of the fill rather than being canceled.</p>

        <p>Once the Attached Order set is sent to the connected Trading service, it will still be active even if Sierra Chart loses connectivity to the Trading service. In the case where your Trading service does not support server side OCO functionality and Sierra Chart is managing that functionality on your local computer, then those Attached Orders will not have OCO functionality if connectivity is lost to your Trading service.</p>

        <p>It is also important to set the <b>Time in Force </b>  of the Attached Orders as you require. You can use either <b>Day</b> or <b>Good till Canceled</b>. Refer to  <a href=" #TimeInForce">Time in Force</a>.  If  the Time in Force for the Attached Orders is not set to <b>Good till Canceled</b>, then they will be canceled at the end of the day for both simulated and non-simulated trading.</p>

        <p>In the case of when the trading service you are using supports server side Bracket orders, the  information in the <a href="#OCOManagement">General Management of Attached Orders</a>  <em>does not apply in any way</em>.</p>

        <p>If a Trading service supports server side Bracket orders, it is necessary to enable server side Bracket orders within Sierra Chart by enabling <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt;  General Trade Settings &gt;&gt; Use Server Side Bracket Orders</b> for them to be managed on the server side.</p>

        <p>When using server side Bracket orders,  both the Parent and Attached Orders are sent at the same time to the Trading service and after that Sierra Chart has <em>no responsibility</em> for the management of them.</p>
        
        <p>Any action on those Attached Orders would only be in response to actions that you perform manually or through an automated trading system.</p>

        <p>The sending of the orders to the exchange, the canceling of them, and Quantity adjustment of the orders is handled completely by the Trading service  and  <em>not</em> by Sierra Chart.  Normally,  this will be safer for the management of orders. However, it is not always advantageous to use server side  Bracket orders because the management of those  orders on the server side by the external Trading service might not be exactly as you would expect as compared to when Sierra Chart is managing them.</p>
        
        <p> However, if you are using a Trading service where there is an <a href="#HandlingOfAttachedOrdersWhenSierraChartIntermediaryServerIsUsed">Intermediary Server is Used</a> the management of the bracket order will be as you would expect. In this case the Attached Orders  will always be managed on the server side and cannot be disabled.</p>

        <p>To know if the Trading service you are using  supports server side Bracket orders, refer to the service specific page linked on the <a href="indexfda3.html?page=doc/SupportedDataAndTradingServices.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data and Trading Services</a> page which states for each service whether the service provides <b>Server Managed Bracket Orders</b> in the  <b>What Is Included</b> section on that page.</p>

        <p>The user interface in Sierra Chart for Attached Orders is designed to be very straightforward. The basic concept is that for each Target (Limit order) or Stop (Stop Order) that you want, this will be 1 Attached Order.</p>

        <p>If you want to have 2  Targets  and a single Stop for the entire position, then this will be 3 Attached Orders.</p>

        <p>Refer to the <a href="#UsingAttachedOrdersImages">images below</a> for a visual presentation.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Attached Orders are configured through the Trade Window for a chart or Trade DOM.  Go to your chart or Trade DOM. Select <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Open Trade Window for Chart</b>.
            <br><br>
            It is important to understand that each Chart or Trade DOM has its own Trade Window. You need to make sure you are  <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#OpeningTradeWindow" >opening</a> and using the Trade Window belonging to that particular chart or Trade DOM when configuring the Attached Order settings for it.
            <br><br>
            Also be aware  of the  <a href="index69b6.html?page=doc/WorkingWithCharts.html#ChartLinking" >Chart Linking</a> feature which also supports linking Trade Windows to keep  the settings the same among the linked ones.
            </li>

            <li>You will see the <b>Targets</b> tab on the Trade Window.  Select this tab.  This is the tab for Attached Orders. Although the tab is named <b>Targets</b>, it also applies to Stop Attached Orders as well.</li>

            <li>If you want to start completely fresh with your own Attached Order configuration, then press the <b>Remove</b> button until all of the Attached Orders in the list box above are removed. Initially, you will normally see 2 Attached Orders already added which make up a simple bracket. There is one  <b>Target</b> order and <b>Stop</b> order. You can keep these Attached Orders and modify them as required and add additional ones.</li>

            <li>Press the <b>Add</b> button  to add an Attached Order.  The Attached Order will be added to the list box above. 

            <li>The controls on the   <b>Targets</b> tab control the selected Attached Order in the Attached Order list. To modify an existing Attached Order, simply select it from the list box at the top and modify the settings for it by using the controls below the list box.  We will explain this in more detail.</li>

            <li>The first step is to set proper  <b>Order Type</b>. You can make it either a <b>Target</b> type or a <b>Stop</b> type. 
                <br> <br>
                For Stops you have many <a href="index783f.html?page=doc/OrderTypes.html">Stop Order Types</a> to choose from including Trailing Stops. 
                <br> <br>
                To make the first Attached order a Target, then select <b>Target: Limit</b> in the   <b>Type</b> list.</li>

            <li>Each Attached order has one or more <a href="#OffsetValues">Offset</a> controls. The offsets can be specified as an actual <b>Price</b> value, a number of <b>Ticks</b>, or a <b>Percentage</b> of the last trade price. Select either <b>Price</b>, <b>Ticks</b>, or <b>% (Percentage)</b>.  The default setting is <b>Ticks</b>. For further details, refer to <a href="#OffsetValues">Offset Values</a>.</li>

            <li>In the case of a Target, set the  <b>Limit Offset</b>, to the amount from the parent order where you want the Target order to be. 
                <br> <br>
                For example, if you are setting it in Ticks, and the tick size for the symbol is <b>.25</b> and you want the Target to be 2 points from your entry price, then set  <b>Limit Offset</b>  to 8.
                <br> <br>
                In the case of a Stop, set the <b>Stop Offset</b>, to the amount from the parent order where you want the Stop to be.</li>

            <li>Set the <a href="#OCOGroup">OCO Group</a> for the selected Attached Order. By default this should be set correctly. In the case where there are multiple Targets and a single Stop  and you want the Stop to protect the entire position, then you will need to set the <b>OCO Group</b> for the Stop Attached Order, to <b>All OCO Groups</b>. In this case the Stop will act as a <em>common Stop for all Targets</em>.</li>

            <li>Set the <b>Quantity</b> for each Attached Order. By default, the quantity should be set correctly.  If you are using a  single Target and Stop, then this needs to be set to the quantity of the Parent/main order.</li>

            <li>If the <b>Type</b> is set to a <b>Stop</b> order type, and you want to move the Stop to break even  based on various conditions, then you need to set the  <b>Move to Breakeven for Stop</b> settings as required. Refer to <a href="#MoveBreakevenForStop">Move to Breakeven for Stop</a> for instructions.</li>

            <li>Repeat the steps 4-11 for each Attached Order you want to add.</li>

            <li>At the bottom of the <b>Targets</b> tab, set the <b>Time in Force</b> for the Attached Orders to either <b>Day</b> or <b>Good Till Canceled</b>.</li>

            <li>To have the Attached Orders you have defined, attached to a new order that you submit,  select the <b>Main</b> or <b>C</b> tab and enable <b>Use Attached Orders</b>.</li>

            <li>At this point you are all set and you can now submit  an order and the Attached Orders will be attached to it.</li>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#Rules">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>When you are adding Attached Orders or modifying the controls for Attached Orders, there are certain rules that must be followed. The Attached Orders interface does not allow you to do something which does not follow the rules. If the rules are not  followed, you will notice that changing a setting for an Attached Order will not work. The following are the rules:</p>

        <p>Attached Orders are grouped into <a href="#OCOGroup">OCO Groups</a>.  In the list of Attached Orders you will notice a number after <b>Target</b> or <b>Stop</b>, this will be 1 through 8 or <b>All</b>. This indicates the OCO Group number. </p>

        <p>With this understanding, you can only have one Target and one Stop per OCO group, not more.  Likewise, there can also be only a maximum of 2 orders per group.  These two orders form an OCO pair.  </p>
        
       <p>If a Target or a Stop is in the <b>All Groups</b> OCO Group, this counts as one order for all of the other groups 1-8. So if you have a <b>Target 1</b> and a <b>Stop All</b> Attached Orders, then it will not be possible to add a Stop 1 because <b>Stop All</b> applies to OCO Group 1. There can only be one Attached Order set to <b>All Groups</b>.</p>

        <p>For example, if you have 2 orders set to be a Stop and then you try to set the OCO Group for one of them to <b>All Groups</b>, this will not be allowed because each group cannot have more than one Stop order. <em>In this case what you need to do is first set one of the Stops to be a Target instead and then you can change the other Stop to <b>All Groups</b>.</em></p>

        <p>Each Attached Order is specified with one or more offsets. An <em>offset</em> is how far away from the parent order price that the Attached Order price is.</p>

        <p>There are different 4 different units to specify an offset (Price, Ticks, Percentage, Actual Price). These offsets are relative to the price of the parent order, unless you are using Actual Price in which case you specify the actual price value.  The parent order is the main order that you submit that the Attached Orders are attached to.</p>

        <p>In the case where the parent order is a Market order, then these offsets are relative to the current market price (Last trade price).</p>

        <p>When the parent order fills, these offsets are then always relative to the fill price since the Attached Orders will be adjusted upon a fill or partial fill of the parent order to maintain the specified offsets in the case when a server side bracket order is not being used and  <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Trade Settings &gt;&gt;  Adjust Attached Orders to Maintain Same Offset on Parent Fill</b> enabled.</p>

        <p>The offsets always entered as positive numbers. The Attached Order feature will automatically convert the offset to the proper price value based upon whether the parent order is a Buy or Sell order and the Attached Order Type.</p>

        <p>These are the different ways to specify an Offset value:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Percentage (%)</b> from the parent order price.
                <br> <br> 
                In the case of when using a Percentage (%) for the Attached Order Offset value, the formula is as follows: <b> OffsetPrice =  SpecifiedOffsetAsPercent * 0.01 * BasePrice</b>. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>BasePrice</b> is the main/parent order price in the case of a non-Market order.  In the case of when the main/parent order is a Market order, it is determined from  the Quote Data for the symbol. You can see the Quote Data through the   <b Class = "menu_item">Window &gt;&gt; Current Quote Window</b>. In the case of a Sell Market order the Bid price is used for the BasePrice. In the case of a Buy Market order the Ask price is used for the BasePrice. 
                <br> <br>
                If there is no Quote Data available and the values are zero, then BasePrice is the last trade price in the chart. The result is rounded to the nearest tick.
            </li>
            <li>Number of <b>Ticks</b> from the parent order price.</li> 

            <li>A fixed <b>Price</b> from parent order price.</li>
            
            <li> <b>Actual Price(1), Price Offset(2-4)</b>: This option lets you specify an actual price for the first offset setting and a standard price offset for the second through fourth offset setting.</li>

        <p>An OCO (order cancels order) Group consists of 2 orders. This is a Target and a Stop.</p>

        <p> When one fills or is canceled, the other will be canceled. If you have just a single target or a single stop and not a corresponding stop or target, then there is no OCO group.</p>

        <p>  Although the <b>OCO Group</b> setting needs to be specified for each Attached Order regardless.</p>

        <p> This setting is for associating Targets and Stops into pairs. Each pair will have its own OCO group unless you are just using a single Target or a single Stop.</p>

        <p>  If you want to use a common Stop for multiple Targets, then you would set the <b>OCO Group</b> for that Stop order to <b>All OCO Groups</b> and this will split the Stop into more than one order and  place one order into each of the OCO Groups used by the other Attached Orders. </p>

        <p> The number of orders created from an Attached Order  set to <b>All OCO Groups</b>  will be equal to the number opposite orders. For example if there is one Stop order  set to <b>All OCO Groups</b>, and there are two  <em>Target</em> orders set to OCO Group 1 and OCO Group 2 respectively, then there will be two Stop orders. Not more.</p>

        <p>When an Attached Order in the <b>All OCO Groups</b>  OCO group is split up, the quantity of each of these individual split orders is equal to the quantity of the group that it is placed into. Examples of how this works is explained in the <a href="#AttachedOrdersExamples">OCO Group Examples</a> section.</p>

        <p> The advantage of not using a common Stop when there are multiple Target orders is that the Stop orders can be adjusted independently. Otherwise, they cannot be unless you use the command   <b>Remove Link Between Stop Attached Orders</b> which can be added to the  <a href = "indexf01a.html?page=doc/GlobalSettingsMenu.html#CustomizeChartTradeMenu">Chart Trade Menu</a>.</p>

        <p>If you are using more than one OCO Group, then the parent order quantity is split up into individual smaller orders that equal the number of OCO groups used (maximum of 8).</p>

        <p> Therefore, if you are using 2 OCO groups, then the parent will be split into two independent orders, that are <em>linked</em> together.  The <em>sum of the order quantities for every  OCO group must be less than or equal to the parent order quantity. The Target and Stop orders in each OCO group need to have an identical quantity, which happens automatically.</em></p>

        <p>The reason that parent orders and Stop orders for each OCO Group are split into individual orders and are not combined together is for two very important reasons:</p>

        <p>1. In the case where there is server side OCO functionality, the orders in each OCO group must have identical quantities.</p>

        <p>2. There is a more logical association between orders in an OCO Group when they are independent orders and the orders do not span more than 1 OCO group each.</p>
        
        <p>  When Attached Orders are sent to the external Trading service,  they are iterated through from top to bottom as they are listed in the Attached Orders list on the  <b>Targets</b> tab of the Trade Window. If an  Attached Order has a sibling order, the corresponding Target or Stop  in the same OCO Group, then  as  Attached Orders are processed from top to bottom in the list, the sibling order,  for the currently being processed Attached Order is located in the list and these  are sent at the same time.</p>

        <p>This is the quantity of the Attached Order. All Attached Orders within the same OCO Group must have the same quantity, so this setting specifies the quantity for the entire group.  </p>
        
         <p>When the  <b>OCO Group  </b>  setting is set to <b>All OCO Groups</b>  for an  Attached Order, then its Quantity is automatically set and is equal to the parent order quantity.</p>
        
        
        <p>  When 2  Attached Orders are in the same OCO Group, changing the quantity of one of them will automatically change the quantity of the other to match.  </p>
        
        <p> When using a common Stop order  to be the Stop order for more than one Target order,  then the   <a href="#OCOGroup">OCO Group</a> setting   needs to be set to     <b>All OCO Groups</b>. </p>

            <p>The following are the possible types of move to breakeven actions that can be performed on a Stop order type. Choose the one that you require.  Depending upon which one you have chosen determines what other settings are required.</p>

               <li><b>OCO Group Triggered</b>: When this option is selected and the Target order in the specified OCO Group has partially or fully filled, then the Stop order will be moved to the breakeven level.</li>
               
               <li><b>Trail to Breakeven</b>: When this option is selected, the Stop order will immediately begin to trail the market price  when the parent order fills or partially fills, and stop at the breakeven level.</li>
               
               <li><b>Trail to Breakeven Offset Triggered</b>: When this option is selected, and the trigger price calculated from the  <b>Trigger Offset</b> setting is reached, then the Stop order will begin to trail the market price and stop at the breakeven level.</li>

        </section>

        <section class="h4">
            <h4 id="MoveBEForStopsLevelOffset">Breakeven (BE) Level Offset</h4>
            <div class="member-link">[<a href="#MoveBEForStopsLevelOffset">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

            <p>The breakeven level is the parent order fill price. The parent order is the order that the Attached Orders are attached to.  This parent order fill price is the breakeven/reference price when the Stop order is moved to the breakeven level.  </p>

            <p> When using the  <a href="#ScalingIn" >Scaling-In</a> functionality, this breakeven price is adjusted and uses the  weighted-average of the original parent price and the fill prices of the orders used for scaling in. The <b>Breakeven (BE) Level Offset</b> specifies the number of Ticks from this breakeven price that the Stop order will be moved to.  </p>

            <p>If you specify 1 for the Breakeven Level Offset, the breakeven level price is 100 and the Tick Size is 1, then a Sell Stop will be moved to 101 when triggered.</p>

           <p> In the case of a Trail to Breakeven Stop, the trailing action will end when the Stop order gets to 101.</p>
           
            <p>This level offset can be either a positive or negative number. With the preceding example, if you use a offset of -1, then the Stop order will be moved to 99.</p>
            
            <p>The move to breakeven action does not occur if the Stop order is moved beyond the calculated breakeven level.  For example, in the case of a Sell Stop order, the Stop order price has to be less than the breakeven level price plus the Breakeven Level Offset for the Stop order to be moved.</p>

            <p>This specifies the offset <em>in Ticks</em> that the current market price needs to move to from the parent order fill price, to trigger the move to breakeven action.  For example if the parent order fills at 100, it is a Buy order, the Tick Size is 1, Trigger Offset is set to 5, then when the market reaches 105 the attached Sell Stop will be automatically moved to the breakeven level.</p>
           
           <p> This Trigger Offset  remains the same even after any modification to the Stop Attached Order. </p>

            <p>This setting only applies when you have set the <b>Type</b> to <b>OCO Group Triggered</b>.  When the Target  order in the selected OCO Group fills, then the  Stop order, which will normally be in a different OCO Group, will be moved to the breakeven level. In order for this to work, there must be a Target order defined in the specified OCO Group.</p>
            
            <p>If you are using a single Target order  and there is just one  <b>  OCO Group</b> being used for the Attached Orders, then normally it would not make sense to be using the <b>Move to Break Even for Stop</b> functionality because once the   Target order fills,   the Stop order is going to be canceled. Although if the  Target order consists of  a quantity of more than 1,  then it can fill at more than one time. Therefore using <b>Move to Break Even for Stop</b> in this case may make sense.
            <br> <br>
             The more typical case,  is there are two or more  Target orders, and the Move to Breakeven functionality  is set on   the common Stop order, which is using  <b>All OCO Groups</b>, or set on a Stop order which uses a <em>different OCO Group</em>.</p>

    <p>When Sierra Chart submits an order, it will first split up the order into the number of OCO Groups you are using. For example, if you are using 3 different OCO Groups, there will be 3 different parent orders (each with the quantity specified with the <a href="#GroupQuantity">Group Quantity</a> setting). For more information about OCO Groups,  see the <a href="#OCOGroup">OCO Group</a> section. Sierra Chart will manage all of the OCO Groups for you.

        <p>After the parent order is submitted with Attached Orders, the Attached Orders go into a held state until the parent order is filled.</p>

        <p>When the parent order fills or partially fills, the Attached Orders are adjusted so that the Attached Order offsets from the parent order  fill price are exactly the same as you have specified in the Attached Order settings, if <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; General Trade Settings &gt;&gt;  Adjust Attached Orders to Maintain Same Offset on Parent Fill</b> is enabled.</p>

        <p>This adjustment does not occur in the case of Server side managed Bracket orders.</p>

        <p>Once the  parent order is filled or partially filled, the  Attached Orders  activate with a quantity matching the filled quantity of the parent order. For example, if  a parent order has a quantity of 5, and it partially fills  to a quantity of 3 with 2 remaining, then the Attached Orders become active with a quantity of 3 each.</p>

        <p>When an Attached Order completely fills, the other order (sibling order)  in the same OCO Group is automatically canceled.</p>

    <p> Follow the instructions below to change the configuration of  Attached Orders for a parent order after the parent order  has been submitted and filled.   If the parent order has not been filled,  then just simply cancel the parent order, which will cancel the Attached Orders, and  resubmit  the parent order along with the  Attached Orders configuration that you require.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>For the easy ability to switch among different Attached Order configurations, <em>save</em> each configuration as a <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#SavingConfiguration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade Window Configuration</a>. </li>

        <li> Cancel the existing Target and Stop orders. For instructions, refer to  <a href="index3c50.html?page=doc/ChartTrading.html#ModifyingOrdersOnTheChart" Target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modifying and Canceling Orders on the Chart</a> on the Chart Trading page.</li>

    <p>To use a common  Stop order when there are multiple Target Attached Orders,  only add 1 Stop order and set the OCO Group for that Stop order to  <b>All OCO Groups</b>.</p>

    <p>When this is done, there will be multiple Stop orders created, one for each Target order.  After modifying one of these stop  orders on a chart or Trade DOM after the are submitted, the other Stop orders in the Attached Order set will be automatically adjusted at the same time.</p>

    <p>If you want to immediately close an existing position and cancel the Attached Orders it is recommended to use the   <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#FlattenCancel">Flatten and Cancel</a> operation.</p>
    
    <p>  Another method by which you can close fully or partially a position that has a Target and Stop order is to simply  modify the price of the Target/Limit Attached Order towards the current market price and slightly beyond it. It will then immediately  fill at the current market price.</p>
    
    <p>  It is not necessary to move it to a precise price. Simply move it to the other side of the current market price. Opposite from the side the Limit order is on. </p>
    
    <p>  You cannot do this with the Stop  Attached Order because this type of Stop order modification will get rejected by the exchange.</p>

    <p>In this case, new Attached Orders are <em>not submitted</em> with the new order.</p>

    <p>Scaling In  does still work even  in the case   where you have reduced the  Order Quantity on the Trade Window to a quantity less than the configured Attached Orders and there is the <b>NoMatch</b> error at the top of the Trade Window.  </p>

    <p> In this case, that message can be ignored.  There is not a need that the new order quantity match the quantity of the Attached Orders since there is a   Scale In operation that will be performed.</p>

        <li>There are already Attached Orders working on your trade account for the symbol. Attached Orders that are in a <b>Pending Child/Server</b> state are not considered.</li>
       
       <li>  There is an existing Long  Trade Position  for the same Symbol and Trade Account  the new order is submitted for and you are increasing the Long Trade Position quantity. <br> <br>

        <li>Or, there is an existing Short  Trade Position  for the same Symbol and Trade Account  the new order is submitted for and you are increasing the Short Trade Position quantity. <br> <br>
        
       If the Position Quantity is not correct  or is 0, then there will be a problem with  the Scale In functionality. Refer to <a href = "index7cfb.html?page=doc/TradeStatusWindows.html#IncorrectlyReportedTradePositionQuantity">Incorrectly Reported Trade Position Quantity</a>.</li>

In the  <b>Scale  In</b>  setting, choose from one of the following:  <b>Nearest Orders, Furthest Orders, Even Distribution-Maintain Ratios, Even Distribution</b>. 
        
         <br> <br>
         When using  <b>Even   Distribution</b>, the quantity of the new submitted order  which will increase the Trade Position,   upon a fill will be evenly distributed across the Attached Target and Stop orders until there is no further available quantity.</li>
    </ol> 
    
    
    <p>  The  <b>Scaling In</b> functionality  works under the conditions documented above and can be used no matter  how a new order is submitted. This functionality is also supported with automated trading systems including the   <a href = "indexf70c.html?page=doc/SpreadsheetSystemsAlertsAndAutomatedTrading.php">Spreadsheet System for Trading</a> study. </p> 
    
    <p> When an order that meets the  scale in conditions  fills, the  scale in action will be performed. If this order  partially fills and there are therefore multiple fills, each one of those fills will cause the scale in action to be performed.</p>

        <p>Sierra Chart provides a study named  <b>Trade Management By Study</b>. This study will modify  an existing working Target or Stop <a href = "#Introduction">Attached Order</a> for the symbol of the chart to match the most recent value of a selected <em>Study Subgraph</em>  in a study.  </p>
        
        <p>This Study Subgraph is used to set the order price of the Target or Stop. An offset from this Study Subgraph is also supported.  The <a href = "index4604.html?page=doc/StudiesReference.php&amp;ID=17&amp;Name=Line">Line</a> study can also be referenced and you can set the level of the line  through is Study Input.</p>
        
        <p> The nearest Target or Stop order  is considered the one nearest to the current trade price.</p>

        <p>The study monitors the chart for Open Attached Orders (Targets or Stops). These are Attached Orders that are currently  <b>Open</b> due to a parent order that was previously filled.  The orders must have a   <em>Status</em> of   <b>Open</b>  for them to be modified  by this study.  </p>

         <p>If no orders exist,  the <b>Trade Management By Study</b> will not do anything.  These Target and Stop Attached Orders  can also have originated from a different chart.</p>

        <p>Once an Open Target or Stop is found, then based on the most recent value of the selected Study Subgraph, the  <b>Trade Management By Study</b> study will continuously modify the order price to match.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to control both the Target and Stop according to a Study Subgraph, then you can add two <b>Trade Management By Study</b> studies to the chart and set one to control the Target and the other one the Stop. This is done through the <b>Order Types to Manage</b> Input with the study. </p>


        <p>Full source code for the study can be found in <b>\ACS_Source\AutomatedTradeManagementBySubgraph.cpp</b> in the folder that Sierra Chart is installed to.

            <li><b>Order Adjustment Timing</b>: Determines when or how often to modify the Target or Stop order. Supports two methods <b>On Bar Close</b> and <b>Every N Seconds</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>On Bar Close</b>: Will use the referenced study Subgraph value at the previous bar in the chart.</li>

            <li><b>Trailing Offset (in Ticks)</b>: The offset in Ticks (<b class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Tick Size</b>) which the order trails the controlling Study Subgraph by.
                <br> <br>
                A positive or negative value can be used for <b>Trailing Offset</b>.
                <br> <br>
                For a Long position, the order being controlled would be a Sell order. In this case, the  <b>Trailing Offset</b> value is subtracted from the Study Subgraph value. As an example, if the Study Subgraph is a Moving Average, a positive value for the offset would trail the order N ticks below the Moving Average. A negative value would trail the order N ticks above the Moving Average.

                <br>
                For a Short position, the order being controlled would be a Buy order. In this case, the <b>Trailing Offset</b> value is added to the Study Subgraph value. As an example, if the Study Subgraph is a Moving Average, a positive value for the offset would trail the order N ticks above the Moving Average.

            <li><b>Only Modify Stops In One Direction</b>:  When this  Input is set to Yes and the  Attached Order being modified is a Stop order, then in the case of a Short Trade Position, the  Stop order will only be  modified to a lower price and not to a higher price.  In the case of a  Long Trade Position, the  Stop order will only be  modified to a  higher price and not to a  lower price.  When this   Input is set to  No, then a Stop order can be modified in either direction.</li>

            <li><b>Allow Zero Values</b>:   When this  Input is set  to Yes,  then zero values will be used from the controlling  Subgraph to adjust the order. Otherwise, this is not the case.</li>

            <li><b>Allow Negative Values</b>:  When this  Input is set  to Yes,  then negative values will be used from the controlling Study Subgraph to  adjust the order.  Otherwise, this is not the case.</li>

            <li><b>Allow Custom 'Properties' for Control Bar Button</b>: When this  Input is set to Yes, then the ACS Control Bar  Button specified by the  <b>ACS Control Bar Button # for Enable/Disable </b> Input can use its own custom properties.

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#AttachedOrdersInLiveEnvironment">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>This section documents specific cases where Attached Orders may not always function as expected. Do know that these are uncommon conditions. In simulated trading, these conditions cannot occur.</p>

        <h3 id="MarketMovingQuicklyBeyondStopPriceMakingItInvalid">Market Moving Quickly Beyond Stop Price Causing It to Become Invalid</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#MarketMovingQuicklyBeyondStopPriceMakingItInvalid">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p><b>Example Scenario</b>: You have an attached Sell Stop order that has been submitted with your main parent buy order.</p>

        <p>The parent order that the attached Stop order is attached to, fills and then the market moves quickly against your resulting position.</p>

        <p>When the Stop order is transmitted on a fill of this parent, the market price has already moved below the Sell Stop order price.</p>

        <p>Normally exchanges will reject Sell Stop orders with a price which is at or above the current market price. Likewise in the case of a Buy Stop order.   A Buy Stop order can be rejected if it is at a price below the current market price.</p>
        
         <p> This is an example of the rejection: <b><em>Sell order stop price must be below last trade price (this is an exchange level rejection)</em></b>. </p>

        <p> This type of scenario only happens when you use a tight Stop, the market is moving quickly against your entry order,  and the exchange has rejected your order.</p>
        
         <p> The first and primary solution to a problem like this is to use the  <a href = "index6880.html?page=doc/SierraChartOrderRoutingServiceWithData.php">Sierra Chart Order Routing Service</a> to have very low latency management  of your Attached  Orders, so they are sent to the exchange in less than 1-2  milliseconds after the parent fill, usually,  rather than a much longer delay when  they are managed on the Sierra Chart client side.  We cannot emphasize enough the benefit of using  this service compared to other services like CQG.</p> 

        <p>  Another solution to this problem  is to use the <a href="#AutomaticReplacementMarketOrder">Automatic Replacement Market Order for Rejected Stop Attached Order</a> functionality.</p>

        <p>There are many safeguards in place to ensure that this market order is only sent when there is a rejected Stop Attached Order and when there is an actual established Trade Position from the original parent order.</p>

        <p>When this market order fills, any Target order that also exists will be canceled. This feature does not work with Interactive Brokers due to the proven uncertainty of order statuses with that service.</p>

        <p>Example Scenario: There are Attached Orders attached to a parent order. The parent order has a quantity of 10 for example.</p>

        <p>The parents fills in 2 lots of quantities of 5 each. The Attached Orders are transmitted with an initial quantity of 5 each to match the first fill of 5.</p>

        <p>These Attached Orders, then need to be modified to a quantity of 10 each due to the second parent fill of 5. Each of these order modifications are pending until the initial order transmission that they are trying to modify has been  acknowledged and the initial Attached Order goes into an Open state.</p>

        <p>When an Attached Order goes into a Open state and there is a pending modification, that modification is then performed. So therefore the quantity of each Attached Order is increased to 10 individually at the time when the Attached Order has become Open.</p>

        <p>However, say the market price moves and then fills one of  those Attached Orders that we are modifying and it fills before the modification is actually performed and that modification is rejected.</p> 

        <p>For example, the Target order got filled before it could be increased to 10, then you no longer have a Target order in place since the modification to increase it to 10 failed.</p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#FailureToIncreaseQuantityDueOrderModificationRejectionFromMarginPositionLimits">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>Example Scenario: There are Attached Orders attached to a parent order. The parent order has a quantity of 10 for example.</p>

        <p>The parent  order fills  either all at once or in multiple fills. The Attached Orders are transmitted with an initial quantity equal to the first fill of the parent order.  If the parent order completely filled all at once, then the Attached Orders  will have the full quantity at this point in time. </p>
        
        
        <p>If necessary, the  quantity of the Attached Orders are increased  to match any additional fills that may occur in the parent  order, assuming  the parent did not fully fill the first time.</p>

        <p>However,  there is one potential problem. The initial transmission of the Attached Orders or the modification to increase the quantity of the Attached Orders, gets rejected due to a Position limit on your account,   or insufficient margin  to meet margin requirements.  These rejections will be logged in the   <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php">Trade Activity Log</a>.</p>

        <p> The solution to   is to contact the risk management of your trading service and have them increase your position limits, reduce margin requirements or increase your account balance to meet the margin requirements.</p>

        <p>In the case of <em>non-simulated</em> trading, if Attached Orders are managed on the client-side and the Trading server does not provide server side OCO or bracket order support, then until the parent order fills, the Attached Orders are held on the client-side  within Sierra Chart.</p>

        <p>For more information, refer to <a href="#OCOManagement">General Management of Attached Orders</a>.</p>

        <p>Therefore, before the Attached Orders have been sent to the connected Trading server, if you were to enable <b Class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Simulation Mode On</b> before the parent order has filled, and the parent order fills while Trade Simulation Mode is enabled, the Attached Orders will  <em>not be sent</em> to the connected Trading server because Trade Simulation Mode prevents any non-simulated trading.</p>

    <p>When modifying the Price or Quantity of an Attached Order before the Parent order  has filled and it does not change, then the usual case for this problem is that server side Bracket orders are being used and the Trading service Sierra Chart is connected to, is not allowing the modification.</p>

    <p>Stop Attached orders can be moved to the breakeven level using two different methods. By using the  <a href="#MoveBreakevenForStop">Move to Breakeven for Stop</a> functionality on the Attached Order itself, or by using the <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#BreakEvenButton">Breakeven Button</a> on the Trade Window.</p>

    <p>The breakeven price is initially the parent order price. When the parent order fills, the breakeven price is the fill price.  If there are multiple fills, it is the quantity weighted average of the order   fills.    </p>
    
    <p>When using the  <a href="#ScalingIn">Scaling In</a> functionality, and the order quantity of the Stop Attached Order is increased,  the breakeven price is adjusted to be the quantity weighted average of all of the order fills  that increased the order quantity  of the Stop Attached Order during <b> Scaling In</b>. </p>
    
    <p>You can validate the calculation, by performing a   <a href="index9600.html?page=doc/ReplayChart.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chart Replay</a>.  Make sure the <a href="#ScalingIn">Scale In</a>  option is enabled on the Trade Window for the chart itself.</p>

  <p> When you want to submit multiple parent orders each with their own independent Attached Order sets,  it may be confusing to use a single chart or Trading DOM to view and manage these. </p>
  
  <p>  The solution is to use multiple charts or Trading DOMs, one for each parent order and Attached Order set. </p>

        <p>In the event you encounter a scenario where you no longer see the child orders (Attached Orders) for a parent  order, then you may have been connected to another server  due  to some connectivity issue you had to the Primary server  you were previously connected to when  the parent and its Attached Orders  (Bracket order)  were submitted. This will be the case if the parent order has not yet filled.  You will only see the parent order.  When the parent order fills, you will then see the child orders on any of the available servers.</p>
        
        <p>Understand, the child orders are still working  and being  managed on the other server they were originally submitted  to even if you cannot see them,  assuming you know that they were actually submitted previously  which will be the case if you did previously see them  with the status of  <b> Child-Server</b> before the reconnection due to a connectivity problem you had.</p>

       <p> In this case what you can do  <a href = "index8793.html?page=doc/FileMenu.html#ProcedureToReconnect">reconnect to the data feed</a>  which should take you back  to the Primary server  if that was the server the  Bracket order  was submitted to.   </p>

       <p>You will then see the child orders  reappear on the  Chart/Trading DOM and in the   <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Orders Window</b>. Alternatively you could cancel the parent order which then causes the child orders on the other server to also be canceled. You would then need to resubmit the parent order with new Attached Orders  (Although this is going to be unnecessary unless there is a failure with the  Order Routing Server that is holding the child orders which would be very rare). </p>

        <p>However, it is important to understand that in the  <em>very rare  event</em> that the Sierra Chart trading server were to encounter a problem and  therefore lose connectivity  to the trading gateway, the transmission of the Attached Orders (child orders) of a parent order to the trading gateway server when the parent order fills, or the canceling  of one of the orders in an OCO order, or the reducing of the quantity of one of the orders in an OCO order if there is a partial fill of the other order,  <em>cannot happen</em>.  </p>
        

        <p> When the connectivity is restored  to the trading gateway server,  if an order that is in an OCO group no longer has its sibling order because that sibling order has either been filled or canceled, then it will be canceled. </p>

        <p>And if the Attached Orders which are part of a bracket order (a parent order with Attached OCO Order) no longer have a working parent order, they will be canceled as well unless they were already transmitted to the  trading gateway server and put into a working state before the loss of connectivity.</p>

        <p>  This above handling is identical to how Sierra Chart handles these conditions if it were to have a direct connection  to the trading gateway server.</p>

    <!-- p> In the rare event there is some connectivity issue with the server which connects to the trading gateway  which is holding active OCO orders, then you would want to cancel those OCO orders and resubmit new ones. This assumes, you are using server-side managed OCO orders.   In this last case, it really is not easy to tell that this scenario has occurred. It would be very very unlikely but we are just documenting it here for completeness. </p -->
