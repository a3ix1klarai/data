    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#OrderTypes">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>This section lists the various supported order types. It provides a description for them and describes each of the inputs that are specific to them. If an order type can also be used as an <b>Attached Order</b>, then the <b>Attached Order</b> inputs are also described.</p>

    <p> The following are the methods by which an order of any of these Order Types can be submitted:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Through the <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#TradeWindow">Trade Window</a>.</li>
		
        <li>Through the <a href="index3c50.html?page=doc/ChartTrading.html#EnteringOrdersFromTheChart">Chart or Trade DOM</a>. Make sure you add the Order types to the <a href="#ChartTradeShortcutMenu">Chart Trade Shortcut Menu</a>.</li>
		
        <li>If the Order Type is supported as an Attached Order, it can be used as an <a href="index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html">Attached Order</a>.</li>
		
		<li>These orders types are also supported through <a href="index2bf5.html?page=doc/ACSILTrading.html">ACSIL</a>.</li>
		<li>Some, but not all, order types can be submitted through the <a href="index3c50.html?page=doc/ChartTrading.html#UsingTheChartDOMOrderEntryLadder">Chart/Trade DOM / Order Entry Ladder</a>.</li>
    </ul>
	
	<p>When this documentation makes reference to a <em>parent order or parent price</em>, it is referring to the main order that <a href="index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html">Attached Orders</a> are attached to. This is known as the <em>parent</em> order.</p>

        <p>A market order will fill at the current market price. No other price inputs are required.</p>
        
       <p> In the case of a Buy order it will fill at the  lowest available  Sell limit order in the market.  In the case of a Sell order it will fill at the highest available Buy limit order in the market.  Execution should be immediate, so long as there is a matching order.</p>
       
        <p> A market order will provide the fastest execution.  </p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#Limit">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>This is a standard Limit order type. A Limit order is an order to buy or sell at a specific price.</p>

        <p>A buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower, and a sell limit order can only be executed at the limit price or higher.</p>	

        <p>A Buy Limit order which is at or above the current Ask price will fill immediately.  </p>
        
        <p>A Sell Limit order which is at or below the current  Bid price will fill immediately.  </p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#Stop">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>This is a standard Stop order type. A Stop order is an order to buy or sell once the price of the symbol reaches a specified price, known as the Stop price. When the specified price is reached, your Stop order becomes a market order.</p>

            <p>With some of the supported Trading services, a Stop order price cannot be above the current market price for a Sell stop or below the current market price for a Buy stop. If the Stop order price does not meet these rules, the Trading service will reject the order. You will see this rejection for the Stop order displayed in the <a href="index7cfb.html?page=doc/TradeStatusWindows.html#TradeServiceLog">Trade Service Log</a> and also the <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php" >Trade Activity Log</a>. The specific reason for the rejection will be given by the trading service.</p>
            
             <p>These rejections are from the exchange. In the case of when using  <a href = "indexad24.html?page=doc/TradeSimulation.php">Trade Simulation Mode</a>, Sierra Chart will not reject these  Stop orders.</p>
            
            <p>When  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Chart Trade Settings &gt;&gt;  <a href = "index4451.html?page=doc/GlobalTradeSettings.html#RejectStopOrdersThatImmediatelyFill">Reject Stop Orders That Will Immediately Fill</a></b> is enabled, then Sierra Chart will still accept a Buy stop order if it is below the current price by a few ticks and still accept a Sell Stop order if it is above the current price by a few ticks, and send it to the connected Trading service. However, the Trading service still may reject the Stop order. When this option is disabled, Sierra Chart performs no check on a Stop order price in relation to the current market price.</p>
            
             <p> To work around the rejection of a Stop order in this case, you may want to use a <a href = "#TriggeredLimit">Triggered Limit</a> order instead. </p>

        <p>This is a CME order type which only works with the Teton Order Routing Service.

        <p>This is a standard Market If Touched (MIT) order type.</p>

		<p>In the case of a Buy MIT order, it will become a Market order when the last trade price is equal to or less than the Trigger Price. In the case of a Sell MIT order, it will become a Market order when the last trade price is equal to or greater than the Trigger Price.</p>
        
        <p> Based on the above, when using Sierra Chart Trade Simulation Mode,  the order does not need to be touched for it to  become a market order.  In the case of a  Buy Market if Touched order, if the last trade price is simply below that order,  the order will become a market order immediately.  The opposite is true for a Sell  Market if Touched order.</p>

        <p class="GeneralBackgroundHighlightLight">This order type is not supported with all of the supported Trading services that Sierra Chart works with. If it is not supported, then when submitting an order of this type, it will be rejected by the trading service or internally by Sierra Chart if Sierra Chart knows ahead of time that the trading service does not support this order type.</p>

                <p>When used as an Attached Order, this is the Trigger offset value from the parent order price. For example, if this is set to 1 as a Price, then the trigger price for the order will be exactly 1.0 from the parent order price.</p>

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#LimitChase">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>The <b>Limit Chase</b> order type is a Limit order type that is automatically adjusted to follow (chase) the current market price.</p>
        
        <p>To use this order type you can either choose this order type from the list of Order Types on the <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#OpeningTradeWindow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade Window</a> and enter the Limit price. Or you can enable the <b class = "menu_item">Menu/M  &gt;&gt; Orders &gt;&gt; Use Limit Chase Orders</b> option on the Trade Window menu. In this last case, when submitting a normal Limit order, it will be converted to a <b>Limit Chase</b> order.</p> 
        
        <p>The <b>Limit Chase</b> order type is also supported as an Attached Order. In this particular case, the <b class="menu_item"> Menu/M  &gt;&gt; Orders &gt;&gt; Use Limit Chase Orders</b> option on the Trade Window menu does <em>not apply</em> to Attached Orders. </p>
        
        <p>When the <b class="menu_item"> Menu/M  &gt;&gt; Orders &gt;&gt; Use Limit Chase Orders</b> option on the Trade Window menu is enabled, then a Limit order entered from the Trade Window, the Chart DOM, the Trade DOM, the chart, or an automated trading system, will be converted to a Limit Chase order.</p>
        
        <p>The maximum chase amount in Ticks is set through <b>Set &gt;&gt; Max Chase for Chase Limit Orders</b> on the <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#OpeningTradeWindow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade Window</a>. Refer to the image below for the location of this setting.</p>

        <p>When using the Limit Chase order type, the order will automatically be modified up in the case of Buy Limit orders and down in the case of Sell Limit orders.</p>
        
        <p>After the order is submitted, and the last trade price rises in the case of a Buy order, then the order is adjusted up by the amount the last trade price increased by, no more than the specified <b>Set &gt;&gt; Max Chase for Chase Limit Orders</b> amount.</p>
        
        <p> If there is no last trade price available, then the average of the Bid and Ask prices will be used if those are available. </p>
        
        <p>If the last trade price declines in the case of a Sell order, then the order is adjusted down by the amount the last trade price decreased by, no more than the specified <b>Set &gt;&gt; Max Chase for Chase Limit Orders</b> amount.</p>
        
        <p>It is recommended to run a <a href="index9600.html?page=doc/ReplayChart.html">Chart Replay</a> and experiment with the <b>Limit Chase</b> order type to get an understanding of how it works.</p>
        
        <p>In the case of when using an Attached Order, the chase action does not begin until the parent order fills.</p>

        <p>The <b>Limit Touch Chase</b> order type functions similar to the <a href="#LimitChase">Limit Chase</a> order type. The only difference between these order types is that the Limit Touch Chase order type does not begin the chase action until its Limit price is touched by the last trade price of the market.</p>
        
        <p> The specific definition of being touched by the last trade price is in the case of a Buy   Limit order, the last trade price is less or equal to the limit price.  In the case of a Sell  Limit order,  the last trade price is greater than or equal to the limit price. </p>
        
        
        <p>Once the Limit price is touched, then the Limit Touch Chase order type functions the same way as a <b>Limit Chase</b> order type.</p>
        
        <p>The <b>Limit Touch Chase</b> order type can be submitted as both a main/primary order or used as an Attached Order.</p>

        <p>The Triggered Step Trailing Stop order type is a trailing stop order type that trails the market price in steps of the <b>Trail Offset</b>.  </p>
        
        
         <p>The trailing action <em>only begins</em> when the <b> Trigger Price</b> has been reached. </p>
        
        
         <p>For example, if you are using a Sell Triggered Step Trailing Stop type, the initial stop price is 95, the market price is 100, the <b>Trail Offset</b> is 5, and the <b>Trigger Price</b> is 110, then when the market price moves to 110, the trailing action will begin and at that time the stop will be moved to 105. When the market moves to 115, then the stop will move to 110. The movement is not tick by tick, rather it steps as the <b>Trail Offset</b>.</p>

        <p>If you manually <em>modify</em> the Triggered Step Trailing Stop order, then the <b>Trail Offset</b> does not change as in the case of other trailing stop types when <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Chart Trade Settings &gt;&gt; Adjust Trail Offset When Modifying Trail Order</b> is enabled.</p>
        
        
        <p>This Order Type can also be used in combination with the   <a href = "index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html#MoveBreakevenForStop">Move to  Breakeven for Stop</a> settings for an Attached Order.  </p>

        <p>The OCO (order cancels order) Buy Limit Sell Limit order type, consists of a Buy Limit order and a Sell Limit order in an OCO group. So when one order is filled or canceled, the other order will be immediately and fully canceled. You can enter this order through the Trade Window of the chart by selecting this order type and specifying the <b>Buy Limit</b> and <b>Sell Limit</b> prices. Submit the order by pressing either <b>Buy</b> or <b>Sell</b> on the Trade Window.</p>
        
        <p>Or you can use the <a href="index3c50.html?page=doc/ChartTrading.html">Chart Trading</a> feature. For chart trading, right-click on the chart at the Buy Limit price and select <b>OCO Buy Limit Sell Limit</b>. Move your   Pointer to the Sell Limit price and left click. If this order type command is not listed, then it will need to be added. To do this, select <b class="menu_item"> Global Settings &gt;&gt; Customize Chart Trade Menu</b>. <b>Add</b> all of the order types that you want to use.</p>

        <p>This order type supports <a href="index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html">Attached Orders</a>. If the option <b>Use Attached Orders</b> on the Trade Window is enabled, then a set of Attached Orders will be attached to each Limit order.</p>

        <p>The Sierra Chart <a href="index3c50.html?page=doc/ChartTrading.html">Chart Trading</a> feature also provides an <b>OCO Buy Limit Sell Limit Auto Set</b> command. To use this, it is first necessary to determine the offset for the orders, in Ticks, from the center price that you select on the chart. Go to the <b>Set</b> tab on the Trade Window of the chart and set the <b>Auto-Set Prices Offset for OCO Buy Sell Orders</b> to the number of Ticks that you want the orders offset from the center price by. Once this is set it does  not need to be set again. It is saved with your Chartbook.</p>
        
        <p>Right-click on the chart at the center price and select <b>OCO Buy Limit Sell Limit (Auto Set)</b> on the menu. Both a Buy Limit and Sell Limit order will be entered above and below the center price based upon your specified offset in Ticks. If this order type command is not listed, then it will need to be added. To do this, select <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Customize Chart Trade Menu</b>. <b>Add</b> all of the order types that you want to use.</p>

        <p>There are two possible reference prices for the Attached Orders. The <em>selected price</em> and the <em>Average Position Price</em>. The reference price is the price that the Attached Order <b>Limit/Stop Offsets</b> are relative to.</p>
        
        <p><b>Send Attached Orders by Position</b> will use the Average Position Price, if you have a position, as the reference price for the Attached Orders. <b>Send Attached Orders by Price</b> will use the price you specified or right-clicked at on the chart, as the reference price for the Attached Orders.</p>

        <p>The <b>Triggered Limit</b> is similar to a <b>Stop Limit</b> order, except that the <b>Triggered Limit</b> is a <a href = "#ManagementOfTrailingStopOrders">client-side managed order</a> type which means until such time that the Trigger price is met, the Limit order is <em>not</em> sent to the external   Trading service. When the Trigger price has been met, then the order is sent as a Limit order.</p>
        
        <p>When the  Limit order becomes active after the trigger price has been met, then it will only fill according to the standard rules for a Limit order.  When using the <b>Triggered Limit</b> as a Stop  <em>Attached Order</em>, once the  Trigger  has been met, depending upon the price of the Limit order, the Limit order is not necessarily going to fill right away. The market can continue to have traded  through the  Trigger but yet the Limit order will only fill according to the standard  Limit order rules. Refer to  <a href = "#Limit">Limit Order</a>.   You need to set the  <b>Attached Order Limit Offset</b>  to a larger amount than the <b>Attached Order Trigger Offset</b> to ensure that  the Limit will fill right away if that is what you require.</p>
        
        
        <p>This order type  allows for the Limit Order Price to have a negative or positive offset from the Trigger price. Whereas with the standard Stop-Limit order, the  Limit price can only be considered a positive offset, meaning that the buy or sell will always be at a less favorable price than the Stop Trigger price.</p>

        <p>A Triggered Limit can be entered using any of the standard order entry methods. </p> 
        
        <p>This order type can also be entered from the chart using any of the following  Chart Trading shortcut menu commands.   If these commands are not listed on the shortcut menu, then they need to be added. To do this, select <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Customize Chart Trade Menu</b>. <b>Add</b> all of the order types that you want to use. For more information, refer to <a href="index3c50.html?page=doc/ChartTrading.html#EnteringOrdersFromTheChart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chart Trading</a>. </p>

            <li><b>Sell Triggered Limit (Auto-Set)</b></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When not using the <b>Auto-Set </b> commands you can interactively set both the Trigger and  Limit prices allowing you to identify and modify the price levels based on chart patterns that develop. First the Limit  price is set upon selecting the menu command and then the Trigger price is set with the next left click.</p>
        
        <p> In the case where you want to submit a Buy Triggered Limit order, the Trigger Line needs to be   <em>above</em> the current market price  and the Limit price will be below the Trigger price. In the case where you want to submit a Sell   Triggered Limit order, the Trigger Line needs to be <em>below</em> the current market price and the  Limit price will be above the Trigger price. </p>

        
        <p>When using the <b>Auto-Set </b>  commands, then the Trigger price is first set and the Limit price is automatically set. The offset the Limit price has from the Trigger price is set through the <b>Set &gt;&gt;  Trig (Triggered) Limit Offset </b>   setting on the  <b>Set </b> tab of the  <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#OpeningTradeWindow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Trade Window</a> for the chart. </p>
        
        <p>When modifying a Triggered Limit order on the chart, before the trigger has been met,  only the  Trigger price can be modified.   Upon modification of the Trigger price, the Limit price will be automatically adjusted to maintain the same offset it has to the  Trigger price.

        <p>The Trade Volume Triggered Stop order is triggered based on both trade volume and price. This order type requires both a Price and Volume. Volume represents the number of contracts or shares traded.</p>

        <p>In the case of a <b>Buy</b> Trade Volume Triggered Stop, when the last trade price is at the order price or higher, the trading volume of the symbol is accumulated and when it meets or exceeds the set Volume for the order, then the order is submitted as a market order immediately.</p>

        <p>In the case of a <b>Sell</b> Trade Volume Triggered Stop, when the last trade price is at the order price or lower, the trading volume of the symbol is accumulated and when it meets or exceeds the set Volume for the order, then the order is submitted as a market order immediately.</p>
        
        <p> The calculation of the trading volume is a simple sum of the volume of the trades as they  occur for the symbol  while the order is active.</p>
        
        <p>This is a client-side managed stop order.   For complete details about this, refer to <a href="#ManagementOfTrailingStopOrders">Sierra Chart Management of Trailing Stop and Chase Orders</a>. </p>

        <p>Normally you should be using a   <a href = "#Stop">Stop</a> order. Stop with Last Triggering is managed on the client side  and may only be useful with cash Forex markets where the Forex trading service may trigger a stop order based on bid/ask prices.  It does not make sense to use a Stop with Last Triggering in the futures markets.  Since in the futures  markets,  stop order triggering is always going to be based upon the last trade price anyway. </p>

    <h2 id="ManagementOfTrailingStopOrders">Sierra Chart Management of Trailing Stop and Chase Orders</h2>
    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ManagementOfTrailingStopOrders">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>  The price modifications for  <b>Trailing Stop</b>, the price modifications for  <b>Limit Chase </b>   and the management of all client-side managed orders, like  <b>Triggered Limit</b> orders, are managed by Sierra Chart.  </p>
    
    <p> This information also applies to the  <a href = "index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html#MoveBreakevenForStop">Move to Breakeven for Stops</a> functionality for Attached Orders.</p> 

    <p>   This information also applies to the   <b>Send Order at Time</b> <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#TimeInForce">Time in Force</a> type.</p> 
    
    <p>Therefore, in order for these price modifications and triggering actions to occur based upon the current market price, the following must be true. Otherwise,  no actions will take place on the order and it will remain the same.</p>
    
    <ul>
       <li>Sierra Chart must be running and be connected to the Data or Trading service ( <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Connect to Data Feed</b>), or be running a replay. In the case of live trading Sierra Chart must be connected to the Trading service.
       <br> <br>
       Keep in mind if Sierra Chart loses connectivity to the Data or Trading Service server, the Trailing Stop order prices will not be updated in this case as well, unless you are running a replay and using Sierra Chart Trade Simulation Mode. In the case of client-side managed orders, triggering actions can also not be performed.</li>
      
      <li> Real-time data needs to be received for the symbol or the chart needs to be replaying and updating. When you expect the trailing stop to move, there has to be price movement within the chart as well. </li>

       <li>The chart or Trade DOM the orders were entered from needs to remain open and continue to be set to both the same Symbol  and  <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#SelectingTradeAccount">Trade Account</a> that the order is for.</li>
       
       <li>In the case of a chart,  <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Chart Trade Mode On</b> needs to be enabled.</li>
       
       <li>The <b Class = "menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Data/Trade Service Settings &gt;&gt; Common Settings &gt;&gt; Number of Stored Time and Sales Records</b>  should be set to at least 5000 to ensure no trade record data is missed when processing through all of the trade prices. This applies to a chart updating with real-time or delayed data, or during a chart replay.</li>

    </ul>
    
    
    <p>When a Trailing Stop or a Limit Chase order is modified based upon the specifications given on this page for the <a href="#OrderTypes" >Order Type</a>, then this will be in response  to movement of the last trade price. </p>
    
   <p> These order modifications are logged in the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log &gt;&gt; Trade Activity</b> tab.  For more information about viewing these order modifications, refer to <a href="index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php">Trade Activity Log</a>.</p>

    <p>You are able to see the last trade price which actually triggered the order modification of a  Trailing Stop or Limit Chase order.  When looking at an order modification line in the Trade Activity Log, look at the <b>OrderActionSource</b>  field. It will say <em><b>Auto trail order modification. Trigger price: [price]</b></em>. The <b>Trigger price</b> is the price which triggered the modification of the order.</p>
    
    <p> Sierra Chart does not support the use of server modified trailing stop orders because the functionality available from the Trading service cannot support  all of the needed  trailing stop and move to breakeven functionality that Sierra Chart has.     Therefore, to have  one particular trailing stop type modified by the server and all the others not, creates an inconsistency and confusion. </p>
    
     <p>The other reason Sierra Chart does not support the use of server modified trailing stop orders is because Sierra Chart works with multiple Trading services and it is impossible to reliably integrate to the limited trailing stop functionality they all have.  And none of the Trading services will support all of the trailing stop functionality needed anyway.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#EffectOfDelayedDataOnTrailingStops">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>
    
    
    <p>Sometimes market data can be delayed even if this delay is only 100 milliseconds. In the case of when using Interactive Brokers True Real-time Data, this data is delayed 5000 milliseconds.  </p>
    
    <p>This delayed data which is received  will be used to modify  Trailing Stops, Limit Chase  orders and is used for Move to Breakeven for Stops actions.  If this delayed data occurred  before a Limit or Stop order became active as in the case of an Attached Order, then this could cause some unexpected behavior where the order will have been modified according to prices which occurred before the fill of the parent order. </p>

    <p class = "GeneralBackgroundHighlight"> This order entry study has now been replaced  by the <a href="#TriggeredLimit">Triggered Limit</a> built-in order type. </p>

    <p>Sierra Chart provides a study named <b>Trading: Triggered Limit Order Entry</b> which is a managed order entry study.</p>

    <p>This managed order entry study adds commands to the Chart Shortcut menu displayed when right clicking on a Chart or Trade DOM to provide user interaction.</p>

    <p>The strategy implemented is a common entry method in which when price reaches a Trigger level, at that time a <a href="#Limit">Limit order</a> is submitted which price needs to pull back to in order for it to fill. This entry style is often employed at either resistance / support levels on a breakout or on a pullback within an existing trend.</p>
    
    <p>This order entry study also serves as an example on how advanced order entry based on price action can be achieved with the Sierra Chart <a href="index513e.html?page=doc/AdvancedCustomStudyInterfaceAndLanguage.php">Advanced Custom Study Interface and Language</a>. The source code for this study can be found in the <b>/ACS_Source/OrderEntryStudies.cpp</b> file in the folder where Sierra Chart is installed to.</p>

             <li>If you want the Limit order price to be automatically set, set the <b>Auto Set Limit Price</b> study Input to Yes. In this case, set the <b>Limit Price Offset in Ticks</b> to the number of price ticks the limit order should be automatically set from the Trigger level.</li>

            <li>In the Trade Window, set the Order <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#Quantity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantity</a>. The Limit order submitted by the <b>Trading: Triggered Limit Order Entry</b> study will use this quantity.</li>
            
            <li>If you want <a href="index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attached Orders</a> to be sent along with the submitted Limit order, then enable <b>Use Attached Orders</b> on the Trade Window and go to the <b>Targets</b> tab on the Trade Window and configure the Attached Orders.</li>
            
            <li>Make sure there is a checkmark by <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Chart Trade Mode On</b>. This enables the study's custom menus.</li>
            
            <li>Enable <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Auto Trade Enabled</b> if it is not already enabled on the menu.</li>
            
            <li>Set the <b>Trigger Line</b> by right clicking on the chart at the trigger price level and selecting <b>Set Trigger Price</b> on the displayed menu. In the case where you want to submit a Buy Limit order, the <b>Trigger Line</b> needs to be <em>above</em> the current market price.  In the case where you want to submit a Sell Limit order, the Trigger Line needs to be <em>below</em> the current market price.</li>
            
            <li>After setting the <b>Trigger  Line</b> you will see the Trigger Price displayed in text format displayed right on the chart and a study Subgraph line appear on the chart representing the Trigger Line.</li>
            
            <li>If <b>Auto Set Limit Price</b> input is set to <b>Yes</b>, then the Limit Order will be automatically placed at a price that is defined by the <b>Limit Price Offset in Ticks</b> input. For example, if the <b>Auto Set Limit Price</b> is set to <b>Yes</b>, the <b>Limit Price Offset in Ticks</b> is set to 10, the <b>Tick Size</b> for the chart is <b>0.25</b> and the trigger is set above the current last price in the chart at a price of <b>2845.00</b>, then the system will automatically place a Buy Limit at 2842.50 (2845.00 - 0.25 * 10).
            <br>
            If the <b>Auto Set Limit Price</b> is set to <b>No</b>, then the <b>Limit Order Price</b> must be manually set by right clicking on the chart at the level you want the Limit price at and selecting either <b>Set Buy Order Price</b> or <b>Set Sell Order Price</b> on the menu. These options to set the Limit Order do not display in the right click menu until after the Trigger Price is set.
            
            <ul>
                <li>For a Buy order: The Buy Limit order price <em>must be below</em> the Trigger line. </li>

                <li>For a Sell order: The Sell Limit order price <em>must be above</em> the Trigger line.</li>    
            </ul></li>

            <li> To modify the order price, left click and drag the Trigger Line displayed on the chart to the new location. You just need to left click and drag at the price level and not necessarily directly on the line itself. The Order Line is automatically adjusted to maintain the same offset.</li>
            
            <li>To cancel the order, right-click on the  chart and select <b>Cancel Triggered Limit Order</b>.</li>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#StopOrdersCME">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>A <em>Stop</em> order with a single price submitted from  Sierra Chart and placed through to one of the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) exchanges (CME, CBOT, COMEX, NYMEX), will be converted by the CME to a <em>Stop-Limit</em> order. </p>

    <p> The Limit price will be set to a price, calculated by the CME, which prevents it from filling if the market moves too far away from the Stop price. The limit price will be significantly far away from the Stop price.</p>
    
    <p>When using some Trading services, like Teton, you will see the order type change from Stop to Stop-Limit after it has been submitted and accepted by the exchange. You also will see the <b>Price2</b> order price for the order, set to the actual limit price set by the exchange.</p>

    <p>Understand that this behavior is all normal and expected and is a safety feature implemented by the CME to maintain an orderly market.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#FullyClientSideManagedOrders">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p> Order Types which contain the word "Client"  in their name mean these are fully client-side managed orders and are not sent to the external trading gateway until such time that the  documented condition has been met.  </p>
    
     <p>Until that is the case, they have a   "Held" order Status. You can look at the   <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Trade Activity Log</a> to determine when these orders are transmitted to the external trading  gateway. </p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#UnderstandingWhyOrdersDoNotFillAtExpectedPrices">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>
    
     <p> If you experience an issue, where an order  than you would expect, the first step is to understand you would expect, the first step is to understand what was the Order Type of that order. </p>
     
     <p> To determine the order type, use the   <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b>.  Refer to the <b>OrderType</b> field  along the  record a line for the order.  For complete documentation, refer to    <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Viewing Historical Trade Activity</a>.  </p>

     <p>Once you determine the order type,  and if you are entering the order through the Chart DOM you need to be aware of the   <a href = "index4451.html?page=doc/GlobalTradeSettings.html#ChartDOMSettings">Chart DOM Settings</a>. The order type   will be determined  by the following: Whether you left or right right clicked in the columns. Where you  clicked  relative to the last trade price. Whether you clicked in the Buy or Sell column. And finally the Chart  DOM  Settings.</p>
    
    <p>In the case of the Limit order you need to understand how these orders are filled in relation to the current prices. Refer to <a href = "indexad24.html?page=doc/TradeSimulation.php#LimitOrders">How Limit Orders Are Filled</a>. </p>
    
    <p>For example, if the current price is 100, the bid price is 100 and the ask price is 101 and you put a Buy Limit order in at 105, it will immediately fill at 101 which is the ask price.</p>


    <p>In the case of a Stop order, you need to understand how these orders are filled in relation to the current prices. Refer to <a href = "indexad24.html?page=doc/TradeSimulation.php#StopOrders">How Stop Orders Are Filled</a>.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#OrderRejectedFromOutsideOfBands">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>
 
     <p> An exchange usually will maintain a maximum upper price and a minimum lower price around  the current price of a symbol, which  order prices have to be within.  This is called the price bands.  Almost always orders that you submit will be within this range of prices.   </p>
     
     <p> If a  Limit or Stop  order you submit is outside the upper or lower band, then the exchange will reject the order. </p>
      
     <p> One solution is to change the    <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#TimeInForce">Time in Force</a> type from <b>Day</b>  to <b>Good  till Canceled</b>. And resubmit the order. This should allow you to put an order outside of the price bands.  </p>
     
     <p> Refer to  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfdANLloz-I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a>   which provides a full explanation of all of this.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ReducingSlippageFromStopOrders">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>



    <p>This section explains how to reduce or eliminate slippage from Stop orders.  However, it is important to be aware, that when you follow these instructions there is the risk  that the stop order will not be filled  and therefore not act as a protective stop. </p>
    
     <p>  To minimize slippage for a Stop order, it is essential to use a  <a href = "#StopLimit">Stop-Limit</a> Order Type either as the main entry order or as an  <a href = "index0ef8.html?page=doc/AttachedOrders.html">Attached Order</a>  depending upon  where you are using the Stop order. </p>
     
     
     <p> Once you are using a Stop-Limit order, then go to the <b>Set</b> tab of the <a href = "index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#OpeningTradeWindow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade Window</a> for the Chart or Trading DOM. </p>

    <p> Set the  <b>Stop-Limit Order Limit Offset &gt;&gt; Offset Type</b> to  <b>Ticks</b>. </p>
    
    <p> Set the  <b>Stop-Limit Order Limit Offset &gt;&gt; Primary Orders</b> to the maximum number of ticks that you want for slippage. For example, this could be anywhere from 1 to 4. Or a higher value. It all depends upon what you want. </p>
    <p>  Make the same change for  <b>Stop-Limit Order Limit Offset &gt;&gt; Attached Orders</b>. </p>
