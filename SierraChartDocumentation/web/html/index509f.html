    <a href="../images/tradeactivitylogfills.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/tradeactivitylogfills.png" class="WideFloatRight" alt="" ></a>

    <p>To open the Trade Activity Log, select <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b> on the menu.</p>

    <p>The Trade Activity Log logs trade order Activity and trade order Fills. Whenever there is a new trade order or a change with the order status (<b>Status</b> field in the <b class ="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Orders Window</b>) of an existing order, there is a new line added to the Trade Activity Log. And there is a new line added whenever an order fills or partially fills. There is a separate line for each individual fill.</p>

    <p class="GeneralBackgroundHighlightLight">The Trade Activity Log is very useful to analyze <em>precisely</em> what has happened with a particular order and the source of all actions on that order. Every time the <b>Status</b> of an order changes, the prices of the order change, the quantity of the order changes,   there is a change with any of the order identifiers, or there is an order fill, then there is a separate line  added for the order in the Trade Activity Log.  </p>

    <p>To determine all of the actions on an order, be sure to select <b> All Activity </b> in the list box at the top of the Trade Activity Log, containing these options. In the log itself, the field <em><b>Order Action Source</b></em> indicates what the source of the action on the order was.  This field also provides other useful subfields of information.  For additional information related to this field, refer to <a href = "index1290.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLogAnalysis.php#DeterminingOriginOfOrder">Determining the Origin of a New/Modified Order</a>.</p>

    <p>In the case of Non-simulated trade activity in the Trade Activity Log, this trade activity is added to the log based on real-time order events received from the Trading service you are connected to and historical order fills and order data (if available) downloaded when connected to the Trading service.  It is important to be aware that there can be missing  order fills. For more information, refer to <a href="#MissingOrderFills">Missing Order Fills from Trade Activity Log</a>.</p>


    <ol>
        <li>To view the Trade Activity Log, select <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b>.</li>

        <li>Select the <b>Trade Activity</b> tab.</li>
        <li> Make sure  <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Disable Trade Activity Log</b> is  <em>unchecked/disabled</em>.</li>

        <li>At the top of the Trade Activity Log window, select the type of Trade Activity that you want to display, from the drop-down of Activity Types. This can be <b>Orders, Fills,  Positions, Account Balance</b>, or <b>All Activity</b>.</li>

        <li>At the top of the Trade Activity Log window, in the list box containing Internal Order IDs, select <b>All Internal Order IDs</b>. </li>

        <li>At the top of the Trade Activity Log window, in the list of symbols select the symbol that you want to display trade activity for.
            <br> <br>
            In the case of simulated trading when using Sierra Chart <a href="indexad24.html?page=doc/TradeSimulation.php" >Trade Simulation Mode</a>, the symbol is prefixed with <b class="GeneralBackgroundHighlight">[Sim]</b>. So you <em>must select the symbol that has [Sim] in front of it to see simulated trading data</em>.

        </li>

        <li>To display <em>non-simulated</em> Trade Activity data for all symbols, select <b>All Symbols</b> in the list of symbols.  This is Trade Activity with the external  Trading service Sierra Chart is connected with.
            <br> <br>
            To display <em>simulated</em> Trade Activity data for all symbols, select <b>[Sim] All Symbols</b> in the list of symbols. Simulated Trade Activity  data  is simulated  Trade Activity recorded when <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Simulation Mode On</b> is enabled.</li>

        <li>At the top, in the list of Trade Accounts, select a particular Trade Account that the orders belong to. Or select <b>All Accounts</b>. This account must match the account used on the Trade Window for the Chart or Trade DOM the orders originated from. All simulated trading accounts are in the format <b>Sim#</b>.
        <br><br>
        For performance reasons, not all Trade Accounts are going to be listed if there are a lot of Trade Accounts, or if the history for a Trade Account is not recent. You just need to manually type the Trade Account into the box at the top of the Trade Accounts list box.
        </li>

        <li>In the list box containing Internal Order IDs, select   <b>All Internal Order IDs</b> unless you want to display only Trade Activity for a particular Internal Order ID. In that case select the particular Internal Order ID you want to display.</li>

        <li>Set the Date-Time controls in the <b>Date Range to Display</b> frame to the Date-Time range that you want to display. It is essential that the  <b>From</b> Date and Time corresponds to a point in time where the Position for a particular Symbol and Trade account was flat in order for there to be correct generation of Trade Statistics and Trades. 
            <br> <br>
            In the case of the Date field, either  select a date from the list or manually enter one in the format <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b>. In the case of the Time field, manually enter the time in 24 hour format  (HH:MM:SS).

        <br> <br>
        Upon pressing the  <b>Apply</b> button, a background query  for the data will be made and then will be displayed in the log list below.

        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#OrdersFillsAllActivityFilter">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>This list box filter allows you to display  Orders, Fills, Positions, Account Balances,  or All Activity (all trading related activity). </p>

        <p><b>Order</b> Activity  is the details of an order every time the order status changes, the order quantity changes  or the price changes. New orders are also logged. </p>

        <p><b>Fill</b> activity is the details of a fill when an order fill occurs.  One thing  to understand about Fill entries in the Trade Activity Log is first there is an order update indicating a fill. In this case there will be an entry, with the  <b>ActivityType</b> set to  <b>Order</b>.   And then there will be another  second entry specific for the fill with the same <b> Order Action Source</b> field, with the <b>ActivityType</b> set to <b>Fill</b>.</p>

        <p><b>Positions</b> activity is every time there is a change in position quantity for a Symbol and Trade account. </p>

        <p><b>Account Balance</b> activity is anytime there is a change with the cash balance for the  Trade Account but this is only used with trading services where Sierra Chart  fully provides the server-side functionality.  At this time it is only used with the <b>Futures Trading Evaluator</b> service. </p>

        <p>Note: In the case of a fill, the <b>Fill Price</b> field is the price of that specific fill. In the case of Order Activity, the <b>Fill Price</b> field is the average price of all of the fills, if any, for the order at the time of the logging.</p>

        <p>This list box lists all of the Symbols that have Order and Fill activity available in the Trade Activity Log. Select <b>All Symbols</b> to display Trade Activity for all non-simulated symbols.  </p>

        <p>Select <b>[Sim] All Symbols </b> to display Trade Activity for all simulated symbols. Or, select a specific symbol to display only trade activity for that particular symbol.</p>

        <p>Usually non-simulated symbols are for live orders. However, if you are connected to a simulated trading account with your Trading service, the these will actually be simulated orders. However, to Sierra Chart they would be considered live/non-simulated orders.</p>

        <p>Symbols with <b>[Sim]</b> in front of them will display Trade Activity data for orders which are simulated and processed internally in Sierra Chart. This also includes Order and Fill Trade Activity for orders which were submitted from a chart or charts that were <a href="index9600.html?page=doc/ReplayChart.html">replaying</a> or during an automated trading system <a href="indexe891.html?page=doc/Backtesting.php">Back Test</a>. These are simulated orders only because only simulated orders are possible when a chart is replaying or there is a Back Test being performed.</p>

        <p>Select <b>All Notes</b> unless you want to display only Trade Activity that has a particular note. In that case select the particular note you want to display.</p>

        <p>The Notes are created by entering a Text Tag on the Trading Window for the chart. For more information, refer to <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#TextTag">Text Tag</a>.</p>

        <p> the  <b>From  &gt;&gt; Date</b> and  <b>Time</b> and  <b>To   &gt;&gt; Date</b> and  <b>Time</b> controls set the period of time of the trade data to display on all of the tabs of the Trade Activity Log (Trade Activity, Trade Statistics, Trade, Period Stats).  </p>

         <p>  The  <b>From  &gt;&gt; Date</b> and  <b>Time</b> and  <b>To   &gt;&gt; Date</b>  settings  are used to filter data based upon the <b>Date-Time </b>  field of each trade activity entry.   You need to keep in mind that when you are performing a chart replay, that all trade activity being recorded uses the Date-Time of the time  <em>being replayed</em> and not the current time.  So you need to keep that in mind when setting the <b>From  &gt;&gt; Date</b> and  <b>Time</b>  setting. </p>

        <h3 id="UseCommission">Use Commission</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#UseCommission">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>


        <p> The  <b>Use Commission</b> checkbox on the   <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b> applies a <em>round turn commission</em> per quantity 1 for the Profit/Loss calculations on the <a href="#TradeStatisticsTab">Trade Statistics</a>, <a href="#TradesTab">Trades</a> and the <a href="#PeriodTradeStatsTab">Period Trade Stats</a> tabs of the <b Class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b>.</p>

        <p>The actual Round Turn Commission currency value is set through <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Symbol Settings</b> for the symbol or symbol pattern. Select the <b>Round Turn Commission</b> value in the list of settings for the symbol or symbol pattern selected in the Symbols list in the <b>Global Symbol Settings</b> window. </p>

        <p class="GeneralBackgroundHighlight"> Be sure to enable the <a href = "index4404.html?page=doc/GlobalSymbolSettings.php#UseCustomSymbolSettingsValues">Use Custom Symbol Settings Values</a> option  in the Global Symbol Settings for the <b>Round Turn Commission</b> value you have set to actually get used. </p>

        <p>The currency of the commission value can be any currency and should be denominated in the currency of the symbol.</p>

        <p>Since this is a round turn commission, it applies for every 2 units of the total filled quantity for a Trade. Therefore, if you set a <b>Round Turn Commission </b> of 1.00 and you buy and sell 10 shares or contracts, then  this will be a total quantity traded of 20. The commission will be 10 in this case and the amount will be <em>deducted</em> from the Profit/Loss reducing the profit and increasing the loss.</p>

        <p>In the case of stock shares where the quantities are much higher than futures, you need to take this into consideration when determining the commission value. For example, you may want to set a commission of .01 which would apply per share. So a trade of 1000 shares would have a commission of 10.</p>

        <p>If there are any changes to the commission value in the <b>Global Symbol Settings</b> window, then to see these changes applied to the Profit/Loss calculations, select <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Refresh Log</b> on the Trade Activity Log menu when the <b>Trade Activity</b> tab is selected.</p>

        <p><em>The Round Turn Commission value for a symbol has no effect on any other Profit/Loss values you see throughout the user interface in Sierra Chart. It only affects the <b>Trade Statistics</b> and the <b>Trades</b> tabs of the Trade Activity Log.</em></p>

        <p>For further information, refer to <a href="index4404.html?page=doc/GlobalSymbolSettings.php">Global Symbol Settings</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id="ProfitLossFormat">Profit/Loss (P/L) Format</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ProfitLossFormat">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p> The  <b>Profit/Loss Format</b> setting sets the format for Profit/Loss values displayed on the <b>Trade Statistics, Trades, Period Trade Statistics, Chart Trade Statistics, Account Statistics</b> tabs on the Trade Activity Log. For descriptions for each of the formats, refer to <a href="index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#ProfitLossFormat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Profit/Loss Format</a> on the Chart Settings page.</p>

        <p>When the selected symbol in the Symbol list on the Trade Activity Log is set to <b>All Symbols</b>, then the  <b>Profit/Loss Format</b> is automatically implied to be <b>Currency Value</b>  and therefore this setting <em>does not have any effect</em> on the  Profit/Loss  values displayed.</p>

        <p>When a Profit/Loss calculation is performed using <b>Points-Ignore Quantity</b>, it is performed using all of the order fills which make up the particular Profit/Loss value and the quantity is ignored and considered to be 1.</p>

        <p>Therefore, when looking a Profit/Loss value on the <a href="#TradeStatisticsTab">Trade Statistics Tab</a>, which consists of many trades and the total quantity of those trades, it will be different than the summation of the Profit/Loss values which also ignore quantity on the <a href="#TradesTab">Trades Tab</a>.   </p>
        
        <p>The  Profit/Loss calculation on the Trade Statistics tab is  ignoring the quantity  and a single calculation. Whereas on the Trades tab, the sum of all of the Profit/Loss values  is ignoring the quantity trade by trade  and is accurate. Whereas on the Trade Statistics tab the resulting Profit/Loss value which is ignoring quantity is inaccurate.  This is explained in the paragraphs below.</p>
        
        <p>Due to the fact that the profit/loss format is applied to a profit/loss value when it is displayed  and the profit/loss values exist as currency  values in the calculations within the Trades list, it is not  possible to accurately apply a profit/loss format which ignores quantity to a profit/loss value which consists of multiple trades.</p>

        <p>For example consider a trade that had a 10   Point profit with a quantity of 1. And another trade that had a 10  Point profit with a quantity of 100. So the resulting profit is 20 points with a total quantity of 101 which gives us a .20  Points profit when ignoring the quantity.   However, this is not correct. The actual profit  and Points when ignoring quantity is  10.1. </p>
        
        <p> If you have any problems with the Profit/Loss calculations not being correct, then be sure to  <em>not</em> use one of the  "Ignore Quantity"   Profit/Loss Formats. </p>

            <li>Select the tab on the Trade Activity Log that you want to save. This can be either <b>Trade Activity, Trade Statistics, Trades, Period Trade Stats, Trade Statistics for Charts</b>.</li>

            <li>Only what is displayed on the tab is actually saved to the file. Therefore, use the filtering controls at the top of the Trade Activity Log, to display the data that you require to actually save, before saving the file. To save the <b>Fill Activity</b>, select the <b>Trade Activity</b> tab and make sure the Fills are displayed by selecting <b>Fills</b> or <b>All Activity</b> in the list box at the top of the window containing these options.</li>

    <p>This section documents clearing  <em>simulated</em> or  <em>non-simulated</em> Trade Activity data from the Trade Activity Log.   Data can be cleared for a particular symbol or a particular Trade Account or a combination of the two.</p>

    <p>To quickly clear <em>all</em> the <b>Simulated</b> Order and Fill activity for <em>all  Symbols and  all simulated Trade Accounts</em> from the Trade Activity Log, select <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Clear Trade Simulation Orders and Data</b> on the  main program menu.</p>

    <p>Before clearing the Trade Activity data for a particular  Symbol and/or Trade Account, you should also be aware that you can edit an entry/row in the <b>Trade Activity</b> tab in the Trade Activity Log by selecting that row and using <b class = "menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Edit Trade Activity Entry</b> on the Trade Activity Log menu.</p>

    <p class="GeneralBackgroundHighlightLight">For step-by-step instructions to clear Trade Activity Data, follow the instructions below.</p>

    <p>The reasons why you would want to clear the Trade Activity Log data for a particular Symbol and/or Trade Account is that you may not need the data any longer. Or, possibly the  order fill data for a period of time has a significant number of missing fills, in which case  it may not make sense to hold that data since it cannot generate proper  trading statistics.</p>
    
     <p>  It  is important to be aware that clearing Trade Activity Data  could take a significant amount of time if there  are a lot of Trade Activity data files (<b>TradeActivityLogs</b> subfolder) or these files are large.

            <br> <br>
            The symbols for simulated trading activity are prefixed with <b>[Sim]</b>.
            <br> <br>
            Select <b>All Symbols (Non-Sim)</b> to clear Trade Activity for all  <em>non-simulated</em> symbols.  Select <b>[Sim]All Symbols </b> to clear Trade Activity for all <em>simulated</em> symbols.</li>


        <li>In the list of Trade Accounts at the top, select the particular Trade Account you want to clear Trade Activity data for, or select <b>All Accounts</b> to clear Trade Activity for all Trade Accounts.</li>

        <li>The <b> Date Range </b> setting is not relevant. All Trade Activity data for the selected Symbol and Trade Account will be cleared.</li>

        <li>Press the <b>Apply</b> button. </li>

        <li>Select <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Clear</b> to clear the data. Press <b>Yes</b> to confirm.</li>

        <li>If you have cleared <b>Non-Simulated (Live)</b> Trade Activity, then you may want to disconnect from the trade server by selecting <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Disconnect</b> and reconnect by selecting <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Connect to Data Feed</b>.
            <br> <br>
            By reconnecting to the server, all of the available <b>Non-Simulated (Live)</b> order fills on the server will be re-downloaded and inserted into the Trade Activity Log if they currently are not there. 
            <br> <br>Usually only 1 day of fills will be downloaded because that is all the trade server will have.</li>

            <br>
            <br>
            In the case when trade activity is encoded using JSON, the values are as follows: UNDEFINED = 0, ORDER_STATUS_CHANGES = 1, ORDER_FILL = 2, POSITION_UPDATE = 3, ACCOUNT_BALANCE_UPDATE = 4.          
        </li>

        <li><b>DateTime</b>: The Date-Time of the Order update, Order Fill, Position update or Balance update. In the case of trading which is not from a replay or back test, this Date-Time is based upon your local computer clock. 
            <br> <br>
            Otherwise, the time is from the Date-Time in the chart during the replay or back test at the point in time in which the order update or fill occurred. 
            <br><br>
            The format is: <b>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.US</b>. <b> US </b> equals the true microsecond of the event. Although if necessary it will be incremented in order to create a unique timestamp for every Trade Activity Log entry to prevent entries having the same timestamp. It is incremented until a unique time is found.
            <br> <br>
            If an order fill has an incorrect timestamp or a slightly incorrect timestamp, then it may not match with the correct chart bar in the case of order fills displayed on a chart.  It is important the computer's clock is set accurately  in the case when order fills use that clock (which is not usually the case). To correctly set your computer's clock,  refer to<a href="index3e87.html?page=doc/helpdetails38.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help topic 38</a>. 
            <br> <br>
            During  a  <a href = "index9600.html?page=doc/ReplayChart.html">chart replay</a>, time stamping of the related order activity is always done according to the chart bars, so it is not affected by an inaccurate computer clock.

                <ul>
                    <li><b>[trading service name] Historical fills data (Restored) </b>: This indicates an order fill inserted into the Trade Activity Log which was downloaded from the trade server upon connection to the server. These are inserted when order fills are not received in real-time. This indicates an order fill occurred when Sierra Chart was not connected to the server, had lost connectivity, or for some reason the server did not send the real-time notification of the order fill. What the reason for the lost connectivity is, the Trade Activity Log does not indicate that.
                        <br> <br> 
                        Inserted order fills will not have the <b>Order Type</b> or <b>Internal Order ID</b> set. Only the necessary fields for an order fill are set.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The insertion of an order fill does not affect the current Trade Position quantity. It also does not affect the <b>Position Quantity</b> field for other lines in the Trade Activity Log.
                    </li>


                    <li><b>Canceling due to no order update | Internally marking as canceled. No order update from server.</b>: When Sierra Chart connects to a Trading service server, it requests all of the Open orders for each of the Trade Accounts on the logged in username. If Sierra Chart has a non-simulated order in its order list with the status of <b>Pending Child-Server, Pending Open, Open, Pending Modify</b>, or <b>Pending Cancel</b> and this order is not in the list of Open orders sent by the Trading service, then it will be internally marked as canceled. What this means, is that it is simply set to a Canceled state within Sierra Chart. Sierra Chart <em>does not cancel the order with the Trading service</em> because the Trading service does not know about the order.</li>

                    <li><b>Internally modified order</b>: This only applies to orders which have a <b>Pending Child </b> status. This means that the order modification was internally performed within Sierra Chart and not sent to the external trading service. Simulated orders will not be sent to the external trading service, but unless they have a <b>Pending Child </b> status, they will not show they are internally modified in the Order Action Source field when modified, even though they are internally modified.</li>

                    <li><b>Auto-order modification</b>: This means an ACSIL (Advanced Custom Study Interface and Language) study modified the Price or Quantity of the order.</li>

                    <li>  <b>Notice - An overfill UpdateOrder call has occurred. Overfill Quantity: #. Total filled quantity: #. Order quantity: #</b>: This means that an order fill has been received for the order and the prior filled quantity plus the quantity of the new order fill  exceeds the most recently specified <b>Filled Quantity</b> of the order. The order fill was ignored in this particular case. </li>

                </ul> 
            </section>
        </li>

        <li><b>Internal Order ID</b>: The Internal Order ID. The Internal Order ID of an order is the order number assigned to it by Sierra Chart.</li>

        <li><b>Order Type</b>: The order type. For example: Market, Limit, Stop, (others).</li>

        <li><b>Quantity</b>: The order quantity. When Activity Type is <b>Fill</b> the Quantity is the quantity of the individual fill for the order. Otherwise, this is the total quantity of the order.</li>

        <li><b>BuySell</b>: The side the order is on. This can be either Buy or Sell.  In the case when trade activity is encoded using JSON, the values are as follows:  UNDEFINED = 0, BUY = 1, SELL = 2.</li>

        <li><b>Price</b>: The first price of the order, if it applies.</li>

        <li><b>Price2</b>: The second price of the order, if it applies.</li>

        <li><b>Order Status</b>: The Status of the order at the time it was logged in the Trade Activity Log. For complete descriptions of the different order statuses, refer to <a href="index7cfb.html?page=doc/TradeStatusWindows.html#OrderStatus">Order Status</a>.</li>

        <li><b>Fill Price</b>: In the case when the  <b>Activity Type</b> field is <b> Order</b>, this is the average fill price of all of the fills for the order, if there has been a fill. In the case of when the <b>Activity Type</b> is <b>Fill</b>, this is the price of the order fill itself, if that value is available from the Trading service. 
            <br> <br>
            In the case of Trade Simulation Mode, since there are no partial fills, this will be the price of the single fill for the entire order.</li>

        <li><b>Trade Account</b>: When Sierra Chart is in Trade Simulation Mode, this will be the simulated account number which always begins with <b>Sim</b>. For orders that are sent the connected Trading service, this is the account identifier of the account the order is in.</li>

        <li><b>Parent Internal Order ID</b>: In the case of Order Activity or a Fill from an Attached Order, this is the Internal Order ID of the parent order.</li>

        <li><b>OpenClose</b>:   This will be  <b>Open</b> if the  order fill  is opening a  Trade Position  or increasing the quantity. It will be  <b>Close</b> if the order fill is closing or reducing a Trade Position quantity.   This is determined from the current Position Quantity for the Symbol and Trade Account at the time of the order fill.</li>

        <li><b>FillExecutionServiceID </b>: This is the unique ID for order Fills from an external trading service to uniquely identify the fill.</li>

        <li id="Field_PositionQuantity"><b>Position Quantity</b>: This field indicates the current Trade Position Quantity after the fill occurred that existed at the time of an order fill or update on the order. Not all Trade Activity lines will contain a Position Quantity field. 

            <br> <br>
            Use this field to determine what the current Trade Position Quantity is at any moment in time  for each order fill and each order update. If the Trading server has changed the  Trade Position Quantity, then this field will be updated as well but it will happen on an approximately 10 second delay.
        </li>

        <li><b>High During Position</b>: This field is for order fills, and is the highest price during the Trade Position which would existed at the time of the order fill.  The highest and lowest prices during the  Position are reset at every order fill. So this would be the high just before the reset.</li>

        <li><b>Low During Position</b>: This field is for order fills, and is the  lowest price during the Trade Position which would existed at the time of the order fill.  The highest and lowest prices during the  Position are reset at every order fill. So this would be the low just before the reset.</li>

        <li><b>Note</b>: This contains the <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#TextTag" >Text Tag</a> which originates from the Trade Window for the order. In the case of an automated trading system this is a TextTag variable in the <a href="index2bf5.html?page=doc/ACSILTrading.html#s_SCNewOrder" >s_SCNewOrder</a> structure. </li>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#MissingOrderFills">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>Follow the instructions in the <a href="#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Viewing Historical Trade Activity</a> section to view order fills. At the top of the Trade Activity Log, in the list which lists the Order Activity Types, set it to <b>Fills</b> to see <em>only</em> order fills.</p>

    <p>When the settings at the top of the Trade Activity Log are set correctly including the Trade Account (control that lists Accounts) and the <b>Date Range to Display</b> settings, then all of the order fills which can be displayed based upon those settings, and are already stored by Sierra Chart will be displayed.</p>

    <p>If you do not see the order fills you want to see, then they were never received in real-time by Sierra Chart from the trading server and Sierra Chart was not able to request them from the trading server. For additional information about this, refer to <a href="#AutoInsertionMissingFills">Automatic Insertion of Missing Order Fills For Non-Simulated Trading</a>.</p>

    <p>In general, the only way to be assured all the time of Sierra Chart receiving an order fill is for the order to have been entered from Sierra Chart, and for Sierra Chart to be connected to your Trading service trading account at the time of the order fills. Otherwise, there are various conditions can cause the order fill not to be received by Sierra Chart.</p>

    <p>The order fills need to have a correct timestamp when they are provided as historical fills and the time on the computer needs to be accurate for order fills received in real time. If the time on the computer is not accurately set, this can cause a condition where you can see a real-time received fill in the correct order in the Trade Activity Log but when the Trade Activity Log is refreshed, you will not see it in the same place because it will be moved to the correct location based on its actual Date-Time. However, the time on a computer would have to be significantly off for this to be an obvious problem. For information about setting the computer's Date-Time, refer to <a href="index3e87.html?page=doc/helpdetails38.html">help topic 38</a>.</p>

        <p>You can insert missing order fills automatically by following the instructions below. To the extent this works is conditional upon the amount of historical order fill history available with the particular Trading service being used.

        <p>When using the  <a href = "index35f0.html?page=doc/SierraChartDirectOrderRoutingService.php">Teton Order Routing Service</a>, there is full order fill history available since the beginning of when you started using the service.</p>
        
        <p> There are backups made of the affected Trade Activity Log files, placed in the  <em>Backups</em> subfolder in the Sierra Chart installation folder,  when trade activity is deleted.  Therefore, the data is never permanently deleted. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>  If you are using sub instances of Sierra Chart (started with <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; New Instance</b>), then the below procedure needs to first be followed in the main primary instance of Sierra Chart, and then can be  performed for any sub instances as needed.</li>
            
            <li>Go to <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b> from the main Sierra Chart menu.</li>

            <li>Select the <b class="menu_item">Trade Activity</b> tab with the menu command at the top.</li>

            <li>Select <b>Fills</b> in the top left list box.</li>

            <li>Set the Trade Account from the list box of  Trade Accounts at the top to the specific trading account identifier you want to insert missing order fill history for.  You must select a specific account and <em>not</em>  <b>All  Accounts</b>.</li>

            <li>In the list box of Notes at the top, select <b>All Notes</b>.</li>

            <li>Set the  <b>Date Range to Display &gt;&gt; From</b> to the starting Date-Time that you want to delete the order fills starting from.  This is relative to the time zone you have Sierra Chart set to.   If there are missing Order Fills  and you want to download the missing fills, then use a Date-Time just before the missing fills.</li>

            <li>Select  <em>all</em> of the fills from the top  of the list to the very end by selecting the very first fill at the top by left clicking on it, and then holding the   <b>Shift</b> key on your keyboard and then selecting the very last fill at the end of the list.</li>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#MissingTradeActivity">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>If the trading activity you expect to see in the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log &gt;&gt; Trade Activity</b> tab, it is not displaying, then the very first step is to carefully follow through the instructions in the <a href="#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Viewing Historical Trade Activity</a> section on this page to make sure the filter controls at the top of the Trade Activity Log are set to display the information that you require.</p> 

    <p>In almost all cases, this is the source of a problem of <em>apparent missing</em> data. However, keep in mind that only order and fill activity from orders entered and filled while Sierra Chart is running, is guaranteed to be in the Trade Activity Log.   </p>

    <p>Order and fill activity from trading performed outside of Sierra Chart, is not guaranteed to be in the log. Order fills which occurred when Sierra Chart is not running are not guaranteed to be in the log.</p>

    <p>Another reason for missing Trade Activity data is an unlikely condition  where there is an error was encountered when writing data to the Trade Activity Log. At the time this occurs, a message will be added to the <b Class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Service Log</b>.</p>


    <p>You can have also deliberately cleared trade activity for a particular Symbol and Trade Account and this is another reason for missing trade activity data. </p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#AutoInsertionMissingFills">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>For Sierra Chart provided Trading services which include the Trading Evaluator, Teton Order Routing, and LMAX, historical order fills are requested when Sierra Chart makes a connection to the remote data and trade servers (<b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Connect to Data Feed</b>).</p>


    <p> Other trading services may have historical order fills but they would be very limited and only for the current trading day and they clear at the end of the day.</p>

    <p> However, when using the <a href = "index35f0.html?page=doc/SierraChartDirectOrderRoutingService.php">Teton Futures Order Routing  Service</a> or the  <a href = "index7ada.html?page=doc/SimulatedFuturesTradingService.php">Simulated Futures Trading Service</a>,  <em>there is extensive historical order fills available</em>. This is a dramatic difference compared to the usual 1 day  of historical order fills available with other futures trading platforms!</p> 

    <p> When Sierra Chart connects to the trading server, the missing order fills since the Date-Time of the last order fill that Sierra Chart has in the Trade Activity Log for the Trade Account, are requested. </p>

    <p>Sierra Chart processes these historical order fills and inserts into the Trade Activity Log any missing order fills received. If there are missing order fills inserted, the <b>Trade Statistics</b>, <b>Trades</b>, <b>Period Trade Statistics</b> tabs of the Trade Activity Log are rebuilt.</p>

    <p>The Trades list in a chart, if the chart is maintaining a Trades list and if the Symbol and Trade Account of the chart matches the symbol of the inserted order fills, is also rebuilt.</p>

    <p>If the missing order fills <em>are not available</em> from the server and you are still missing order fills in the Trade Activity Log for a particular symbol, then you may want to follow the <a href="#ClearingTradeActivityData">Clearing Trade Activity</a> instructions for a symbol to reset the Trade Activity for that symbol back to a clean state.  And then if you reconnect to the data feed, whatever historical  order fills are available on the server will then be downloaded, if Sierra Chart supports downloading them from the particular  Trading service being used.</p>

    <p>Or the other possibility is to <em>manually</em> insert missing order fills with <b class = "menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Insert Trade Activity Entry</b> on the <b class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b> menu.</p>

    <p>At any historical point in time when there is order activity for a symbol, and in some cases when there is a connection to the trading server, you can determine the Trade Position Quantity for a symbol.</p>

    <p>Refer to the <a href="#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Viewing Historical Trade Activity</a> section on this page for instructions to set the <b>Trade Activity</b> tab to list trading activity for a specific Symbol, Trade Account and Date-Time range.</p>

    <p>In the <b class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log &gt;&gt; Trade Activity</b>  tab there is a column named <a href="#Field_PositionQuantity" >Position Quantity</a> which indicates the Trade Position Quantity at every order update.</p>

    <p>You may also see a line in the Trade Activity Log when connecting to the trading server which indicates the Internal Trade Position Quantity has been synchronized to the Service Position Quantity and it includes the Trade Position Quantity from the server at that point in time for the symbol.

        <li>In the <b> Date Range to Display</b> frame, make sure the <b> From </b> Date is set to the same day or earlier than the Order Activity that you want to view. Make sure that <b> Today </b> is checked. Press the <b>Apply</b> button.</li>

        <li>The relevant orders should now be displayed. Each order has multiple lines within the <b>Trade Activity</b> tab. The ordering is in time ascending order as long as <b Class = "menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Descending Display Order</b> is not selected. 
            <br> <br>
            An order can be identified by its <b>DateTime</b>, <b>Symbol</b>, <b>Internal Order ID</b>, <b>OrderType</b>, and the other fields. These lines indicate the various statuses and other data for the order. Support needs to see all of the lines for a particular order or orders that you have a question about.
        </li>

        <li>Click on the first line in the list using your Pointer device for the first order or orders that you have an issue with. Press and hold the <b>Shift </b> key on your keyboard. Go to the last line for the order or orders you have an issue with and left click again. This will highlight the order lines. Release the <b>Shift</b> key.</li>

        <li>Select <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Copy Selection</b> on the menu.</li>

        <li>As an alternative you can just copy all of the data that is currently displayed in the Trade Activity Log. To do this, select <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Copy All</b>. It is preferred that you do not do this because it provides too much data.</li>

        <li>Go to your e-mail message or Support Board message, right-click and select <b>Paste</b> to paste a copy of the order activity.</li>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#TradeActivityLogFileToSupport">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>If Sierra Chart Support has referred you to this section, then we want to get one or more Trade Activity Log  files rather than a copy of some of the lines within the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b> window.</p>

    <p>To provide Sierra Chart support  a Trade Activity Log file, follow these instructions.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Open the Message Log with <b class="menu_item">Window &gt;&gt; Message Log</b>. If the message log does not appear select <b class="menu_item">Window &gt;&gt; Reset Windows</b>. It will then appear.</li>

        <li>Scroll to the top of the Message Log.</li>

        <li>You will see a line like the following: <b>Program path: C:\SierraChart\ | (date-time)</b>.   You will need this for the next step.</li>

        <li>Navigate through your operating system file manager window, to that folder obtained in the prior step which in this case is <b>C:\SierraChart\</b>.</li>
        <li> Within that folder open the <b>\TradeActivityLogs</b> subfolder. </li>
        
        <li> This folder contains the trade activity log data files.  There is a separate file for each day and each trade account.  The file name format  for non-simulated trading is as follows:  <b> <em>TradeActivityLog_YYYY-MM-DD_UTC.[TradeAccount].data</em></b>.  The file name format for simulated trading is as follows:<b><em>TradeActivityLog_YYYY-MM-DD_UTC.[TradeAccount].simulated.data</em></b>. 
        <br><br>
        The time range contained within each file is from 00:00:00.000 to 23:59:59.999 UTC (universal coordinated time) time.</li>

        <li> You will need to provide the files which contain data for the particular dates and Trade Account that  you have a question about or Sierra Chart has specifically requested.</li>

        <li>Copy  these files and provide them to Sierra Chart support either as a Support Board attachment or as an email attachment. In the case of the Support Board, the  files <em>will be made private by default</em>. So only Sierra Chart support has access to them. </li>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#RestoringBackupsOfTradeActivityLogs">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p> Follow the instructions below  to restore a backup  of a Trade Activity log  file.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Backups  are made of the affected Trade Activity log files in the <b>/TradeActivityLogs</b> subfolder in the Sierra Chart installation folder, for any  operation that you perform which deletes trade activity data.  
        <br> <br>
        Whether this is deleting specific Trade Activity entries, or performing  a <a href="#ClearingTradeActivityData">Clearing Trade Activity Data</a> operation.  These backup files  are stored in the <b>/Backups</b> subfolder  in the Sierra Chart installation folder on your computer.  
        <br> <br>
        This is an example file name: <em><b>2021-10-12 014240.TradeActivityLog_2021-08-27_UTC.Sim1.simulated.data</b></em>.</li>
        

        <li>To restore one of these files, you will need to  exit from Sierra Chart.</li>

        <li>Move  these files back into the  <b>/TradeActivityLogs</b> subfolder and rename the file without the Date-Time and dot portion to the left of  <b>TradeActivityLog_</b>.</li>

        <li>If a particular file being moved already exists in the destination folder, then you will need to delete the one that already exists before moving the original  one into the  the destination folder.</li>
        
         <li> Another technique is to move the file back into the <b>/TradeActivityLogs</b>  folder, and remove the Date-Time portion of the filename  and change the account identifier portion of the filename to some other nonexistent account identifier.
        <br> <br>
        You can then   <a href = "importingexportingdata.html">export</a> the order fills  for that account, and then  <a href = "importingexportingdata.html">import</a> them back  into Sierra Chart and they will be imported  into the correct existing Trade Activity files.</li>
         
        <li> When done with the file management, start Sierra Chart again. </li>

    <p>Profit/Loss calculations and the display format for Price values in the Trade Activity Log, rely on the Symbol Settings in <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Symbol Settings</b>. These settings include the <b>Value Format</b>, <b>Tick Size</b>, and <b>Currency Value Per Tick</b>. These need to be set correctly for the symbol. If the <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Symbol Settings</b> change for a particular symbol, you need to reapply the settings in the Trade Activity Log. This can be done by going to the <b>Trade Activity</b> tab in the Trade Activity Log and selecting the <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Refresh Log</b> command.</p>

    <p>The same symbol settings that you see in the <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b> window have no affect on the Trade Activity Log in any way. Those are specific for the individual chart only.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#ImportingExportingData">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>It is supported to export and import data on the <b>Trade Activity</b> tab of the <b class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b>.</p>

    <p>The visible contents of the <b>Trade Activity</b> tab can be exported/saved to a tab delimited text file.</p>

    <p>The Order Fills from this text file can be later imported into the same or different installation of Sierra Chart. Only the Order Fills from this text file will be imported. Lines in the file where the <b>ActivityType</b> is "<b>Order</b>" or other types <em>will not be imported</em>. Also, duplicate Order Fills will be ignored. More details about this are explained below.</p>

    <p> The Date-Times of the exported order fills will be in the UTC time zone. If you do not want to import this data, and you want the Date-Times in the global time zone setting you have Sierra Chart set to, then instead use <a href="#SaveToText">Saving to a Text File</a>. </p>
    <p>The prices of the exported order fills will be in the exchange native format. If you do not want prices in this format, then instead use <a href="#SaveToText">Saving to a Text File</a>. </p>    

    <p> If you are running multiple  automated trading system back tests for the same  Symbol and Trade Account, and want to export this data and later  import it, it is recommended for each back  test,  you use a   different Trade Account to keep these tests separate from each other before starting each back test. Refer to <a href="index9473.html?page=doc/TradeWindow.html#SelectingTradeAccount">Selecting Trade Account</a> for instructions.</p>
    
    <p> In the case of when using the   <b class="menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Export</b> command,  the price values are exported in an unadjusted format  which means they are saved as they exist before   applying the  Symbol Price Multiplier. </p>


    <p>Follow the instructions below:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>To export the Trade Activity data, select <b class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b> on the main window menu.</li>

        <li>Select <b>Trade Activity</b> tab at the top of the Trade Activity Log window.</li>

        <li>Follow the <a href="#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Viewing Historical Trade Activity</a>  instructions to display the order fills that you want to export. </li>

        <li> At the top left of the Trade Activity  Log in the list of  Activity Types it is essential to select either <b>Fills</b> or   <b>All Activity</b> if you want to export  order fills. Otherwise, they will  <em>not</em> be exported. The reason this is essential,  is if you are importing this data  into another instance of Sierra Chart, nothing is going to get imported because only order  fills are imported.</li>

        <li>On the Trade Activity Log window select <b class = "menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Export</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter a <b>File Name</b> and press the <b>Save</b> button.    The data is exported to the specified file  into the   <em><b>SavedTradeActivity</b></em> folder in the folder that Sierra Chart is installed to. Any error message  related to the export will be displayed in  <b class="menu_item">Window &gt;&gt; Message Log</b>.</li>

        <li>To  <em>Import</em> the data which was previously exported with the <b>Export</b> command, select <b class = "menu_item">File &gt;&gt; Import</b> on the Trade Activity Log menu.</li>

        <li>Select the file and press <b>Open</b>.  
            <br> <br>
            The Order Fills will be imported and duplicates will be ignored. It is important to understand how a duplicate is determined. A duplicate is solely determined based upon the  <b>Fill Execution Service ID  </b> field.   If another order fill in the Trade Activity Log with the same identifier is encountered, then this imported order fill will be  discarded and not imported.
            <br> <br>
            Any error message related to the  import will be displayed in  <b class="menu_item">Window &gt;&gt; Message Log</b>.
            <br> <br>
            If you are importing order fills  from a source  other than Sierra Chart, it is essential that the <b>FillExecutionServiceID</b>  field is  present for each order fill and is unique for each individual fill.

Where a statistic applies to Flat to Flat trades, for a description of a Flat to Flat trade, refer to <a href="#OrderFillMatchingMethods">Order Fill Matching and Flat to Flat Definition</a>.</p>

        <p>The trade statistics are displayed in a group of rows and columns. The columns break the statistics out into the following groups:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>All Trades</b>: All long and short trades that match the filter conditions selected at the top of the Trade Activity Log are included in this column.</li>
            <li><b>Long Trades</b>: All long trades that match the filter conditions selected at the top of the Trade Activity Log are included in this column.</li>
            <li><b>Short Trades</b>: All short trades that match the filter conditions selected at the top of the Trade Activity Log are included in this column.</li>

            <li><b>Daily Trades</b>: All long and short trades, that match the filter conditions selected at the top of the Trade Activity Log and are contained within the last Date of the fills, are included in this column.  The starting time of the date of the last fill starts at the <b> Date Range to Display &gt;&gt;From &gt;&gt; Time</b>  setting at the top of the Trade Activity Log window. Therefore, all fills including those closing out trades in prior days, that have the same date as the last fill on the <b>Trade Activity</b> tab  and are after the  starting time are included in the Daily statistics.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The first two rows provide the following information:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Symbol</b>: The selected symbol used for the report is displayed. This can be <b>All Symbols </b> if the Trade Statistics report is for all symbols there is order fill data available for.</li>

            <li><b>Profit Factor</b>: Profit factor is the ratio of Closed Trades Total Profit over Closed Trades Total Loss. There is not a way to calculate the Profit Factor  if there is a zero loss.  In this case it just remains at 0. </li>
            
            <li><b>Equity Peak</b>: Highest closed equity value at any point during the sequence of all closed trades.</li>
            <li><b>Equity Valley</b>: Lowest closed equity value at any point during the sequence of all closed trades.</li>


            <li><b>Maximum Runup</b>: From the lowest valley in the profit, to the highest peak in the profit, the difference of these two. In other words, the highest peak in the profit minus the lowest previous valley in the profit.

        <p>The <b> Trades </b> tab of the Trade Activity Log, displays various fields detailing Trades made.</p>

        <p>A <em>Trade</em> is defined as a fill or fills which increases the Trade Position quantity for a symbol and an offsetting fill or fills which reduces the Trade Position back to the previous Trade Position quantity or takes the Trade Position back to flat. This will be considered 1 Trade.</p> 

        <p>The Trades are derived from the individual order fills based upon the selected <b>Symbol</b>, <b> Days Range to Display</b>, <b> Trade Account </b>, and the other settings at the top of the <b Class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt;Trade Activity Log</b>. You can see the individual fills by selecting the <b> Trade Activity </b> tab of the Trade Activity Log and selecting <b>Fills</b> at the top left of the log.</p>

            <p>The <b>Maximum Open Profit, Maximum Open Loss, Flat to Flat Maximum Open Profit, Flat to Flat Maximum Open Loss, Entry Efficiency, Exit Efficiency, Total Efficiency</b> fields are based upon the market data prices for the symbol, that occurred during the life of the Trade. </p>

            <p>The highest and lowest market data prices are recorded by Sierra Chart when connected to the data feed or when replaying a chart, for the order fills which make up the Trade, during the life of the Trade. If these values are inaccurate or zero, it will result in inaccurate calculations or zero values. </p>

            <p> For each order fill, these values are on the  <b>Trade Activity</b> Tab and are <b>High During Position</b>  and  <b>Low During Position</b>.  For an order fill which occurred when the prior Position Quantity was 0, these will be 0. </p>

            <p>For each trade on the  <b>Trades</b> tab, there are the  <b>High Price While Open</b> and <b>Low Price While Open </b>  fields which are used to calculate the <b>Maximum Open Profit, Maximum Open Loss, Flat to Flat Maximum Open Profit, Flat to Flat Maximum Open Loss, Entry Efficiency, Exit Efficiency, Total Efficiency</b> values.  If those two prices are not as expected, then that is the reason for the incorrect value or values. These particular fields are based upon the <b>High During Position</b>  and  <b>Low During Position</b> fields for the order fills on the   <b>Trade Activity</b> tab  for the particular order fills that make up a Trade.</p>

            <p>If you are performing simulated trading and a Trade has been open both during  a chart replay and during real-time chart updating, this can definitely cause an inaccuracy with the <b>Runup, Drawdown, Maximum Open Position Profit, Maximum Open Position Loss</b> calculations.</p>

            <p>There are also the <b>Highest Price During Positions</b> and the <b>Lowest Price During Positions</b> fields on the <a href="#TradeStatisticsTab">Trade Statistics</a> tab.

    <p>The <b>Trade Statistics for Charts</b>   tab displays various trading statistics data for the current Trade Position and for the Closed Trades, both Daily and Cumulative, for charts which are maintaining their own internal Trades list.</p>

    <p>Charts that are in <b>Chart Trade Mode</b>, charts that have a Trade Window open, charts with trading related studies, and Trade DOM chart windows will maintain their own internal Trades list from the order fills for the  Symbol and Trade  Account of the chart.</p>

    <p>In the case of non-simulated trading, the list of order fills held in the Trade Activity Log is from order fills received in real-time and also downloaded from the trade server upon connection to the server.</p>

    <p>Therefore, there is a good probability, that the information displayed in the <b> Trade Statistics for Charts </b> tab over time is <em>not</em> going to be accurate.

        <h3 id="TradeStatsOpenQuantityFieldCalculation">Open Quantity Field Calculation Method</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#TradeStatsOpenQuantityFieldCalculation">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

        <p>This section describes the calculation method for the <b>Open Quantity</b> field on the <a href = "#TradeStatisticsForChartsTab">Trade Statistics for Charts</a> tab of the <b>Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b> which displays the information from each of the internal Trade lists  for those  Charts and Trading DOMs used for trading.  </p>

        <p>This information  <em>also</em> applies to how the Position Quantity is determined from order fills when using  <a href = "index7cfb.html?page=doc/TradeStatusWindows.html#OrderFillCalculatedPosition">Using Order Fill Calculated Positions In Special Cases</a>  and how  the Position Quantity is determined on the  <a href = " #TradeStatisticsTab">Trade Statistics</a> and  <a href = "#TradesTab">Trades</a> tabs and how it is calculated for <em>simulated</em>  trading within Sierra Chart.</p>


        <p> The <b>Open Quantity</b> field  initially starts at 0 and is calculated as described below by processing the order fills, in a <em>time ascending order</em> for a particular Symbol and Trade Account. Therefore,  order fills  are processed in time ascending order according to their Date-Time. There is no association with the particular order a fill is from or matching of fills based upon the association between orders.</p>


        <p>It is important to understand how this calculation is done because it affects Trade Statistics, trade  profit/loss and the matching of order fills which are used in calculations like the  <em>Daily Profit/Loss</em>  and also for the order  fills displayed on a chart.</p>

        <p>  The Trade Activity Log and each chart which is used for trading contains a   Trades list which is processing the order fills  in the same way that you see on the  <a href = "#TradesTab">Trades tab</a> of the Trade  Activity Log. </p>

        <p> It is necessary to understand that a buy order fill increases  the Position Quantity by the  Quantity of that order fill and a sell order fill decreases the  Position Quantity by the   Quantity of that order fill.  </p>

        <p>For example,  starting at the first fill  at the  <a href="#UnderstandingAndSettingTheStartDateTimeForATradesList">Start Date-Time for a Trades  List</a> a buy order fill of 1  and a buy order fill of 2 will  result in a  Position Quantity of 3. And if there is a sell order fill of 1, the  Position  Quantity then becomes 2.</p>

        <p> So the order fills which are loaded into  the Trades list in a Chart or Trade Activity Log are incrementally processed according to an ascending Date-Time order and the  Position  Quantity (Open Quantity)  at each order fill arises from the processing of the fill.  When an order fill is encountered which reduces the Position Quantity,  it is matched to an existing order fill, and which existing fill it is matched with depends upon whether a FIFO or LIFO order fill matching method is used. This is controllable both in a Chart and Trade Activity Log. Refer to <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#UseLastInFirstOutFillMatching">Use Last In First Out Fill Matching</a>.</p>

        <p>So it is the sum of the quantity of each of the order fills starting at the Date-Time set for loading the  order fills for a particular Symbol and Trade account.  Buy fills increase the  Position Quantity and Sell fills decrease the  Position Quantity by the quantity of the fill.</p>

        <p>  The very first fill, loaded in the chart, establishes the Position Quantity starting from a quantity of 0, irrespective of what the actual  Position Quantity was from that fill.   This is why it is extremely essential, that the very first fill loaded in the chart  was the fill that actually started a new  Position for the Symbol and Trade account, and that there are no missing fills from that point in time. Refer to  <a href="#UnderstandingAndSettingTheStartDateTimeForATradesList">Understanding and Setting the Start Date-Time for a Trades  List</a></p>


        <p>  All available order fills at or after the Date-Time of the first bar in the chart for the Symbol and Trade  Account are used in the calculation  except as explained below. </p>


        <p> It is supported to limit the order fills in a chart through the  <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#OrderFillsStartDateTime">Order Fills Start Date-Time</a>   setting or through the <b class="menu_item">Load Order Fills for Current Day Only</b> setting.  For this last option, the start of the trading day is according to the  <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#StartTimeForTradesList">Start Time for Trades List</a> setting. </p>

        <p> When <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#FilterInitialFillsWhichArePartOfExistingPosition">Filter Initial Fills Which Are Part Of Existing Position</a> is set to <b>Yes</b> in  the Chart Settings (there is also the same setting on the  <b class="menu_item">Edit</b> menu of the Trade Activity Log), then when the order fills  are loaded into the Trades  list  in a chart,  the  <em>initial</em> order fills that have a nonzero Position Quantity field on them  and do not initiate a new  Position, are filtered out until one is encountered which initiates a new   Position. At this point, the filtering  stops.  This is so that the order fills are aligned to the start of  a new Position. This is not always going to work perfectly   due to the fact that the Position Quantity field may not be accurate or has not been set, but it helps in many cases. </p>

        <p>Trades can be viewed on the <a href="#TradesTab" >Trades</a> tab of the Trade Activity Log. By looking at the  <b>Open Position Quantity</b> and the  <b>Close Position Quantity</b> fields, you can see exactly how the Position Quantity is arrived at.</p>

        <p>  If the following settings  (in the list below) for a Chart or Trade DOM,   which is maintaining its own Trade list and therefore being displayed on the  <b>Trade Statistics for Charts  (Chart Stats)</b> tab of the   <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b>,  are  <em>different</em> for a symbol, then  you will see the symbol listed  <em>multiple</em> times.  </p>

           There is one important detail to understand about this setting. Although this can be set the <em>same for two different charts</em>, when there is a background query made for the order fills which takes time to complete, usually less than a second but could take significantly longer based upon the amount of trade activity,  the starting  Date-Time of the Trades  list which is based upon  the Date-Time of the first loaded fill  in the Trades list  in the chart, can be different between the two charts  <em>temporarily</em> because they each perform independent queries.
            <br> <br>
           In this particular case, what can happen  is that you see the number of charts listed  in the  <b>Chart Stats</b> tab vary as the queries  for historical order  fills begin to complete to the charts.
           
            <br> <br>

           </li>
        </ul>
        
         <p>You can determine what chart to set these on, by looking at the  <b>Symbol</b> field in the  <b>Chart Stats</b> tab of the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b>. The Chart  Number is displayed  with the symbol. You can find these Chart Numbers through the  <b class="menu_item">CW</b>   menu of the main Sierra Chart program window.

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#OrderFillMatchingMethods">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>Order fills are grouped together into Trades for reporting purposes. A Trade will consist of two order fills. The first order fill increases the Trade Position Quantity  (entry fill) and the second fill decreases the Trade Position Quantity (exit fill).  Or a Trade can be defined as a fill that establishes or increases a Position and an offsetting fill that reduces the size of the Position.</p>

    <p>  In the Trades list and Trade Statistics, there are fields which use the concept of <b>Flat to Flat</b>.  The definition of <b>Flat to Flat</b> is  defined as the sequence of two or more fills which take you from a flat Trade Position, to a non-flat Trade Position, and then back to a flat Trade Position again. Details of each Trade can be viewed on the <b>Trades</b> tab. </p>

    <p> Order fills are always matched using a First in First Out matching method  unless  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Trading &gt;&gt; Use Last In First Out  Fill Matching</b> is enabled. </p>

    <p>Order fills are ordered by Date-Time in a <em>time ascending order</em> in the Trade Activity Log. Therefore, fills are match together based upon their Date-Time. There is no association with the particular order a fill is from or matching of fills based upon the association between orders.</p>

    <p> Additionally,  when an order fill is matched with another order fill  to create a single Trade, they need to have different Sides.   For example, a Buy fill can only be matched with a Sell fill.   The entry fill is considered the opening fill and the exit fill is considered a closing fill without any regard to their Open/Close field with the the order fills themselves. </p>

    <p> For further details, refer to <a href="#TradeStatsOpenQuantityFieldCalculation" >Open Quantity Field Calculation Method</a>. This section explains fill matching from the perspective, of how the  Trade Position Quantity is calculated when matching  fills. </p>

    <p>When order fills are grouped together for creating Trades,  all profit and loss calculations are based upon the actual fill prices and there is no averaging used. </p>

    <p>Looking  at the original fills on the <a href="#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Trade Activity</a> tab and the Trades on the <a href="#TradesTab">Trades Tab</a> will help you understand how the order fills are matched together.</p>

    <p>Profit/Loss calculations in Sierra Chart which are displayed as a <b>Currency Value</b> are done using floating-point numbers. </p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#UnderstandingDailyTradeStatisticsResetTime">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p>On the  <a href = "#TradeStatisticsTab">Trade Statistics</a> tab of the  <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade  Activity Log</b>, the  <b>Daily Trades</b> column contains trade statistics which reset each day.   This reset occurs once there is an order fill which has a timestamp that crosses the <em>reset time</em> as compared to the prior order fill. How this reset time is determined as explained below.</p>

    <p>In the <b> Date Range to Display</b>  frame of the Trade Activity Log, set the  <b>From &gt;&gt; [time]</b> field to what is considered the start of the trading day.   This is the reset time. If this is set to a time other than 00:00:00, the reset time is considered to start in the prior day.  For a further understanding of this, refer to <a href = "index4ec1.html?page=doc/SessionTimes.php#UnderstandingTradingDayDatesBasedOnSessionTimes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding Trading Day Dates Based on Session Times</a>. However, still the  resetting will occur at that time when in is encountered.</p>

    <p> The information in the following paragraphs applies to current versions of Sierra Chart. </p>
    
    <p>For charts which are maintaining their own Trades  list and Trade Statistics which includes charts that are used for   Trading or contain trading related studies, the start of the trading day (the reset time)  is according to the <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings</b> <b> &gt;&gt; Trading &gt;&gt; Start Time  for Trades List</b>  time setting. </p>
    
    <p>  If this Start Time has already been encountered  in the current day, then the reset Date-Time is in the current day.  If this reset time  has not been encountered in the current day, then the reset Date-Time  has already occurred in the prior day. For a further understanding of this, refer to <a href = "index4ec1.html?page=doc/SessionTimes.php#UnderstandingTradingDayDatesBasedOnSessionTimes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding Trading Day Dates Based on Session Times</a>. However, still the  resetting will occur at that time when  it is encountered. </p>

    <p>The start of the trading day is used for Trade Statistics like the Daily Profit/Loss in a chart. There are also various other Trade Statistics accessible through   <a href = "index513e.html?page=doc/AdvancedCustomStudyInterfaceAndLanguage.php">ACSIL</a> and on a Spreadsheet when using the <b>Spreadsheet System for  Trading</b> study, and also when using the   <b>Trading:</b> studies.  All of these will reset at the start of the trading day as explained above.    In the case of a chart the reset will occur when this reset time is encountered.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#UnderstandingAndSettingTheStartDateTimeForATradesList">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>

    <p> The  <a href = "#ViewingHistoricalTradeActivity">Trade Activity Log</a> maintains its own Trades List which organizes order fills into trades and generates the profit/loss for those trades, and maintains detailed trade statistics.</p>

    <p> Charts which are used for trading or charts which require  trading related data which includes Trade Statistics, also maintain their own Trades List which organizes order fills into trades and generates the profit/loss for those trades, and maintains detailed trade statistics. </p>
    
    
     <p> In the case of the Trade Activity Log, the Trades List is used for the following tabs: <a href="#TradeStatisticsTab">Trade Statistics Tab</a>,  <a href="#TradesTab">Trades Tab</a>, <a href="#PeriodTradeStatsTab">Period Trade Stats Tab</a>, <a href="#AccountStatisticsTab">Account Statistics Tab</a>. </p>

    <p>It is important to understand  how to control the very first order fill loaded into the Trades List and to understand how this affects all of the subsequent matching of the order fills and therefore the resulting Position Quantity.  </p>
    
    
    <p>The very first order fill loaded in the Trades List is considered the start of a <em>new</em> Trade Position  starting from a quantity of 0 irrespective of what the actual Trade Position quantity was just before that fill.</p>

    <p> If you do not understand this, you are going to have results that  will be <em>erroneous and nonsensical</em>  in the resulting generated Trade Statistics and Trades and other tabs.</p>  
    
    <p>For understanding of how order fills are matched  and the Position Quantity is determined, refer to <a href="#TradeStatsOpenQuantityFieldCalculation" >Open Quantity Field Calculation Method</a> and <a href="#OrderFillMatchingMethods">Order Fill Matching and Flat to Flat Definition</a>.   This is essential to understand!</p>

    <p> In the case of the Trade Activity Log, the <b> Date Range to Display &gt;&gt; From [Date] [Time]</b>  setting    directly controls the first order fill Date-Time loaded into this  Trades list.</p>

    <p>  For non-simulated trading,  it is supported to  filter out the initial  order fills that are loaded in the Trades list which are part of an existing  Position so that the first fill loaded in the Trades list will always be aligned to the start of a Position.   This ensures accurate fill matching and Trade Statistics. To do this, enable  <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Filter Initial Fills Part of Existing Position</b> on the Trade Activity Log menu. In the case of Simulated trading,  that option is always considered enabled and the filtering occurs. For more information, refer to this video: <a href = "https://www.sierrachart.com/Videos/Order_Fill_Matching_and_Trade_Statistics.webm">Order Fill Matching and Trade Statistics</a>. </p>

    <p>For charts which are maintaining their own Trades  list and Trade Statistics which includes charts that are used for  Trading,  the first order fill Date-Time loaded in the chart is determined by the  <a href = "index4cf4.html?page=doc/ChartSettings.html#OrderFillsStartDateTime">Order Fills Start Date-Time</a> setting. </p>
    
    <p> When setting the Date-Time of the first order fill to load in a Trades list, you need to understand that the order fills may not be available starting from that particular Date and Time. Additionally, you can have other <em>order fills missing</em> from that start Date-Time until the current Date-Time. For further information, refer to <a href="#MissingOrderFills">Missing Order Fills from Trade Activity Log</a>.  It is essential to understand missing  order fills because if they are missing, this will affect the generated Trade Statistics and Trades and therefore will result in erroneous information presented.</p>

    <p>Also refer to <a href="#AutomaticallyAligningFirstLoadedOrderFillToBeginningOfPosition">Automatically Aligning First Loaded Order Fill to Beginning of Position</a>.</p>

    <p>For accurate generation of Trades, Trade Statistics, Profit/Loss values like the Daily Profit/Loss, order fill entries and exits on charts, and the other tabs of the Trade Activity Log,  from the order fills, it is necessary that the first fill loaded into the Trades list in a chart or in the Trade Activity Log is the start/beginning of a position.</p>

    <p>This is explained in the <a href = "#UnderstandingAndSettingTheStartDateTimeForATradesList">Understanding and Setting the Start Date-Time for a Trades  List</a> section.</p>

    <p>There is a way for this to be managed automatically.</p>
    
    <p> In the case of the  <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b>, enable  <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Filter  Initial  Fills Part of Existing Position</b>. </p> 
    <p> In the case  of a chart, enable  <b class="menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt;   Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Trading &gt;&gt; Filter  Initial  Fills Part of Existing Position</b>. </p>
    
     <p> In the case of when using <a href = "indexad24.html?page=doc/TradeSimulation.php">Trade Simulation Mode</a>  or for simulated order  fills, these options are always considered to be enabled. </p>
     
      <p>  When this is enabled, order fills starting at the specified Order Fills Start Date-Time will become filtered  <em>until a fill is found</em> which is the start of a new  Trade Position which may very well be the first fill loaded anyway. </p>
      
     <p> The reason that this  can be achieved with is because the Position Quantity that exists  just after the fill, is recorded with the fill.   Although this is not always the case for order fills downloaded from the remote server.</p> 
    
     <p>  However, when using the  <a href = "index35f0.html?page=doc/SierraChartDirectOrderRoutingService.php">Teton Futures Order Routing  Service</a> or the  <a href = "index7ada.html?page=doc/SimulatedFuturesTradingService.php">Simulated Futures Trading Service</a>,  that the Position Quantity is recorded with each fill   on the remote  trading server.  This is why these services should be the preferred services to use Sierra Chart with because they are above and beyond the capability of other services in this area and many other areas.</p>

    <p> Whereas with other external  Trading services not only do they just provide order fill history for the current trading day, if any, there is no   Position  Quantity recorded with them.  Whereas Sierra Chart provided  Trading services provide order fills for  <em>at least 1 year</em> and have the   Position Quantity.  A dramatic difference!</p>
       
    <p> In addition to the above, it is essential that there are also no missing Order Fills for a period of time in order to generate  a proper  <a href = "#TradesTab">Trades</a> list and  <a href = "#TradeStatisticsTab">Trade Statistics</a>  for that same time  period.   For more information, refer to <a href="#MissingOrderFills">Missing Order Fills from Trade Activity Log</a>.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#TradeActivityNotDisplayingOrClearing_ImprovingTradeActivityQueryPerformance">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>


        <p> When performing some operation which involves the  obtaining or clearing of Trade Activity Data, there is a query made on a background thread   to perform this operation. Until this query  <em>completes</em>, the displaying of the Trade Activity  data will not occur or the completion of the clearing of the  Trade Activity will not occur.</p>
        
        <p> Queries are also made for Trade Activity order fills which are loaded into the Trades list of a chart which is used for  various Trade Statistics calculations, display of order fills, and the Position  Quantity  for a particular chart.   Until this query completes for a particular chart, this data will not display in a chart. </p>

        <p>This query normally will be completed in less than 100 milliseconds but it could take longer.   If there is a huge amount of Trade Activity which has to be processed, perhaps this could take an entire minute or longer.  A long query time is a very unusual case though.</p>

        <p>  There can also be multiple outstanding trade activity queries which need to be processed. Only one can be processed at a time and they are placed in a queue.  So  if there are several outstanding queries that still have to be done,  then doing something like enabling the display of order fills on the chart, will not result in the immediate display  of the fills.  </p> 
        
        
        <p>The queries ahead of the query needed for those fills  needs to complete and then the query for those fills needs to complete. You can see the status of the completed queries in the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Service Log</b>.  And there is also an  indication in the log message of how many outstanding queries there are at the time  of a completed query.</p>
        
         <p>The number of  outstanding queries can also be viewed on the Trade Activity Log through the <b>Query Count</b> indication:</p>
         
         <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../images/tradeactivity_querycount.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../images/tradeactivity_querycount.png" width = "" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" alt=""></a> </div>
        
         <p>  To delete old or excessive  Trade Activity, refer to <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ClearingTradeActivityData">Clearing Trade Activity Data</a>.  </p>

         <p>Another and faster way to clear   Trade Activity data efficiently and in bulk is to go to the <b>TradeActivityLogs</b> subfolder in the Sierra Chart installation folder.  <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ClearingTradeActivityDataThroughFiles">Delete the trade activity files</a> there that you no longer need. For example, if you want to delete simulated trade activity, delete the files  which end with <em><b>UTC.Sim#.simulated.data</b></em>.  Only delete  Trade Activity files when Sierra Chart is not running. </p>

        <p> When Trade Activity  data is cleared following the method described in the <a href = "index509f.html?page=doc/TradeActivityLog.php#ClearingTradeActivityData">Clearing Trade Activity Data</a> section,  backup files are made.   Therefore, delete the backup trade activity files in the <b>/Backups</b> subfolder in the Sierra Chart installation folder.</p>
        
        <p>The following  are examples of operations which will not immediately complete if there  is a long time to complete a trade activity query. So the intended result will take some time to actually occur in this case.</p>

    <ol>
          <li>Clearing Trade Activity. </li>

          <li> Displaying of order fills on the chart. </li>
          
          <li>Determining the current  Trade Position Quantity and Price on the chart for <a href="indexad24.html?page=doc/TradeSimulation.php" >simulated trading</a>, after the chart is loaded.  Or any time there is a change in Chart Settings, there is a reload of the internal Trades list which is used to calculate the current Trade Position Quantity. </li>
          
          <li>  Configuring controls on the Trade Activity Log and pressing the <b>Apply</b>  button and waiting for the results to appear. </li>
    </ol>


  <p>  As of version 2031, trade activity data is now stored in files which contain the trade account identifier rather than multiple accounts within the same file for each day, to improve query performance. To convert any existing files you have, that do not use the trade account, select <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Convert Trade Activity Format</b>.  </p> 
  
  <p> Press <b>Yes</b> to confirm.  The above step only needs to be done once.</p>

    <p> In rare cases, there could be errors when reading a Trade Activity Log file.  If a message like the following appears in the <b class="menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Service Log</b>, then it means that the Trade Activity Log file  has become corrupted or damaged in some way. The file will need to be deleted.</p>

    <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SolvingTradeActivityIncorrectPriceFormattingAndPLValues">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div>
    
    <p>  The price values and the Profit/Loss values displayed in the Trade Activity Log,  depend upon having Symbol Settings  for the symbol.  These are located in  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Symbol Settings</b>.  </p>
    
     <p>Otherwise the price  formatting will be incorrect, the decimal position can be wrong.  And the Profit/Loss values will be wrong as well.</p>
     
     <p>It needs to be understood that order fills relating to one particular Trading service, cannot be properly displayed when the  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Data/Trade   Service Settings &gt;&gt; Current Selected Service</b>, is currently set to a  Trading service different than  the Trading service the order fills  are from.</p>  
     
     <p> Therefore, to look at order fills for one particular  Trading service, requires that  <b class="menu_item">Global Settings &gt;&gt; Data/Trade   Service Settings &gt;&gt; Current Selected Service</b> is set  to that Trading service. When this is changed, you need to select   <b class="menu_item">Edit &gt;&gt; Refresh Log</b> on the Trade Activity Log menu. </p>
     
     <p> Another solution to the problem is to install another installation of Sierra Chart, set to the particular  Trading service that you want to use for viewing order fills from that  Trading service.  Refer to <a href = "index6ebd.html?page=doc/MultipleServices.html">Using Multiple Data and Trading Services at the Same Time</a>.  You can copy the files in the   <b>TradeActivityLogs</b> subfolder in the Sierra Chart installation folder for your current installation, to the same subfolder in that new installation.</p>
      
     <p> Another item to be aware of,  is if your Trade  Activity Log  contains order fills from two  or more different Data/Trading services, and if the  Date-Time  range settings in the Trade Activity Log are including fills from two or more services, you cannot set the Symbol Filter to  <b>All Symbols</b>. Instead, only a specific symbol. Otherwise, the data from two different incompatible symbols will be conflicting.</p>
     
     <p>  There is also the ability to export  Trade Activity data from one instance of Sierra Chart  and import it into another instance. Refer to <a href = "#ImportingExportingData"> Importing Exporting Data</a>. </p>
