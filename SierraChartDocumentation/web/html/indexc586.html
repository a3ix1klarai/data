    <h2>Log of Changes and Improvements to Sierra Chart</h2>
    
    <p>This list contains major items of development, items which are notable, and changes and additions which users need to be informed about.</p>
    
    <p>This is not a comprehensive changes and additions log. It only represents <em>less than 25% of the actual development</em>  performed every day. There are <em>not</em> version notes for each version. The main Sierra Chart documentation is updated as needed relating to the changes and additions.</p>

    <p>In addition to the below listed items for each version, there are also various low-level improvements, issues resolved, and small additions that a release has which are not listed.</p>

    <ul class="NewListing">
        <li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1483>1483 Release Date: 2016-11-08</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1483">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li>Corrected a problem where the last trade price box for TPO Profile Charts was not displaying. This was an issue arising in a recent release.</li>
    <li>New  <b>Volume by Price</b> study Input to adjust volume profiles to not overlap the DOM Graph.</li>
    <li>When using the Spreadsheet Studies and there is a TPO Profile Chart study on the chart, the TPO and Vol Profile Information is now outputted to columns I and J beginning and row 104 instead of the previous a row 85. In the case of a previously saved spreadsheet, you will need to manually delete  the previous TPO and Vol Profile Information from the previously used rows in the I and J columns.</li>
    <li>Updated Rithmic API in the Rithmic bridge program. Updated all internal connection points. Added new server for MES Capital.</li>
    <li>Added support for server side Bracket orders for the CQG FIX Trading service.</li>
    <li>Resolved a problem with Trade Accounts identifiers causing order updates not to match with the corresponding existing order when trading from a secondary instance of Sierra_Chart when using the Transact Trading service in Simulated Live mode.</li>
</ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1480>1480 Release Date: 2016-11-03</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1480">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li>Custom trading keyboard shortcuts are now implemented.</li>

    <li>Corrected a low level bug which could cause abnormal shutdown in Sierra Chart related to flushing of data to  Intraday chart data files and market depth data files. It is not likely that this would have been encountered. However, this is a critical issue that was resolved and it is important for users to update soon to this version or higher.</li>

    <li>Some changes to the <b>Trading: Bid/Ask Quantity Triggered Stop Order </b> study.  Current documentation explains how it currently works.</li>

    <li>Changed the processing of order fills when using the FXCM FIX Trading service to be more reliable in the case when the sequence  of the execution report and position report are not in a specific order. If you are using the FXCM FIX Trading service directly, it is recommended to update to this version as soon as possible. If there are any issues, report them to Sierra Chart Support.</li>

    <li>Implemented market depth stacking and pulling column for the Chart/Trade DOM.</li>

    <li>Various other development.</li>
</ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1478>1478 Release Date: 2016-10-27</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1478">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li>Resolved a problem with historical Intraday data downloading from TD Ameritrade which was resulting in timeout errors, missing data for the current day, and causing the streamer connection to stop.</li>

    <li>Added new order entry study:  <b>Trading: Triggered Stop Order</b>. Full source code is included.</li>

    <li>In the case when a futures chart is active, the Watch List on the Control Bar will now automatically list the futures symbols for the next one year in addition to the symbols in the Associated Watch List for the chart.</li>
    
    <li>With the <b>Volume by Price</b> study, for some of the <b>Volume Graph Period Types</b> which display only a single volume profile, the Input <b> Align to Far Right </b> is no longer considered to be Yes when it is actually set to No. So for existing instances of the study, you may need to manually set this Input to Yes.</li>
</ul>
    </section>
</li><li>
    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1477>1477 Release Date: 2016-10-25</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1477">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li>The <b Class = "menu_item">Analysis &gt;&gt; Build Custom Studies DLL &gt;&gt; Remote Build</b> command is now functional and supports remote building  of a source code CPP file. The source code file is transmitted using a secure TLS connection and the CPP file is deleted after it is compiled or the compiling fails for some reason.</li>
    
    <li> The <b>Simulated/Non-Simulated</b> Order activity source in the  <b Class = "menu_item">Trade &gt;&gt; Trade Activity Log</b> has been removed. The prefix [Sim] in front of a symbol in the Symbols list on the Trade Activity Log indicates whether simulated Trade Activity entries are displayed. There is now a new Internal Order ID list box  at the top of the Trade Activity Log to control displaying order activity for a specific  Internal Order ID. </li>
    
    <li> Corrected a problem where Range bar charts could continuously reload when an older custom study is used on those charts.  </li>
</ul>

    <section class="h3">
        <h3 id=SCVer1476>1476 Release Date: 2016-10-21</h3>
        <div class="member-link">[<a href="#SCVer1476">Link</a>] - [<a href="#top">Top</a>]</div> 
        <ul>
    <li>Universal Renko bars are now properly implemented. This setting can be found in <b Class = "menu_item">Chart &gt;&gt; Chart Settings &gt;&gt; Intraday Chart Bar Period &gt;&gt; Bar Period Type</b>.</li>
    
    <li>The BitMEX (Testnet) Service now goes through a common order routing connection.   This is still a work in progress and is part of a cooperative development effort with BitMEX. More information about this will be available shortly.</li>
    
    <li> Added support when using the Interactive Brokers trading service to automatically calculate the total filled quantity  of an order when an order fill message is received from Trader Workstation, if this field is not provided by Trader Workstation.</li>

    <li>Resolved an issue with the CQG Web API Trading platform service where orders for a particular symbol would not be processed from the CQG system unless the symbol was subscribed to. This would not be a problem if a chart was open for the particular symbol being traded at the time of connection. Also added proper support for maintaining the proper order ID state necessary for order modifications after an order is modified by another CQG client. It has always been the position of Sierra_Chart that when using CQG you should use the <b>CQG FIX Trading</b> service which did not have this particular issue. Using the CQG Web API for trading has always been considered a backup.</li>
    
    <li> This version has the user interface for Custom Trading Keyboard Commands, but these are not yet implemented and will not perform any function at this time.</li>
